## Reference


### Temporal Tables

https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/tables-temp-transient

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE mytemptable (id NUMBER, creation_date DATE);
```

Similar to the other table types (transient and permanent), temporary tables belong to a specified database and schema; however, because they are session-based, they arenâ€™t bound by the same uniqueness requirements. This means you can create temporary and non-temporary tables with the same name within the same schema.


### Having & Group By

https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/having

```sql
SELECT ...
FROM ...
GROUP BY ...
HAVING <predicate>
[ ... ]
```

The condition specified by the HAVING clause applies to expressions produced by the GROUP BY. Therefore, the same restrictions that apply to GROUP BY expressions also apply to the HAVING clause. The predicate can only refer to:


```sql
SELECT ...
  FROM ...
  [ ... ]
  GROUP BY groupItem [ , groupItem [ , ... ] ]
  [ ... ]
```

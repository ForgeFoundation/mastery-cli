/**
 * Time O(((N + 26) * N) * (M - N)) | Space O(1)
 * This code solves the same problem as before, which is finding the length of the longest substring containing the same letter that can be obtained after performing at most k operations on the input string s.

The approach used in this code is to use a sliding window to keep track of the longest substring containing the same letter that can be obtained with at most k operations.

The code defines three functions to help with this approach:

    addRightFrequency - adds the frequency of the character on the right of the window to a frequency map.
    subtractLeftFrequency - subtracts the frequency of the character on the left of the window from the frequency map.
    getCode - converts a character to an index code by subtracting the ASCII code of 'A'.

My guess is that this approach focuses on calculating everything (every posibility) by sliding and having a right and left update.

Also something interesting is that the mappings, 

 s = "abcdeffggg", k = 2

Left|R |W | Current|L |CanSlide|Max|Frequency Map

0	0	1	a		1	true	1	[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
0	1	2	ab		1	true	2	[1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
0	2	3	abc		1	true	3	[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
1	3	3	bcd		1	true	3	[1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
2	4	3	cde		1	true	3	[1,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

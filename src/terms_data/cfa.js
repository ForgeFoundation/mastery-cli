        "term": "Definition of Inflation Premium",

        "prompt": "What does the inflation premium compensate investors for?",
        "answer": "The inflation premium compensates investors for expected inflation and reflects the average inflation rate expected over the maturity of the debt, as inflation reduces the purchasing power of currency."

        "description": "The liquidity premium compensates investors for the risk of loss relative to an investment’s fair value if the investment needs to be converted to cash quickly. US Treasury bills (T-bills), for example, do not bear a liquidity premium because large amounts of them can be bought and sold without affecting their market price. Many bonds of small issuers, by contrast, trade infrequently after they are issued; the interest rate on such bonds includes a liquidity premium reflecting the relatively high costs (including the impact on price) of selling a position.",

        "term": "Definition of Maturity Premium",
        "description": "The maturity premium compensates investors for the increased sensitivity of the market value of debt to a change in market interest rates as maturity is extended, in general (holding all else equal). The difference between the interest rate on longer-maturity, liquid Treasury debt and that on short-term Treasury debt typically reflects a positive maturity premium for the longer-term debt (and possibly different inflation premiums as well).",
        "prompt": "What does the maturity premium compensate investors for?",
        "answer": "The maturity premium compensates investors for the increased sensitivity of the market value of debt to a change in market interest rates as maturity is extended, reflecting the positive difference in interest rates between longer-maturity and short-term debt."

        the NAV has increased to $22 per share. \n\
        During the year, the fund distributed a dividend of $1 per share, \n\
        which you reinvested. Calculate the holding period return.",
        prompt: "What is the holding period return?",
        answer: "Holding period return = (Ending value + Dividends - Initial value) / Initial value * 100\n\
        Holding period return = (($22 * X) + ($1 * X) - ($20 * X)) / ($20 * X) * 100\n\

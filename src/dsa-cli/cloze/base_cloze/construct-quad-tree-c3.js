         * Reasoning:
         * These redundant operations can be avoided if we simply make a recursive call to the four sub-matrices instead of
         *  first checking all the values. Once all four recursive calls are returned
         * , we will decide whether to let these as child nodes of the root node or should be combined 
         * them into one as the root node. This decision will again depend on the values,
         *  but we won't have to check all the cells; instead, we can just check 
         * if the four nodes are leaf nodes and all have the same value (value attribute). 
         * If it is, we can just return a root leaf node with a value same as the four nodes; otherwise, 
         * we will return a node with any value and having these nodes as the respective child nodes.

## Created Features

- [x] Simple `coa` commit and push
- [x] Includes weather for tomorrow and raining chance
- [x] basic credential creation.
- [x] Currency Conversion
- [x] Crete database for events
  - [x] Post that database
  - [x] Use that database to get publish and edit faetures
  - [x] Features Progress Tracking
- [x] Terms Testing
- [x] Daily reports [database]
  - [x] What you wrote for your journal the same day 1 year ago. 1 month ago. 1 Week ago + 1 Day ago.
- [x] Indicate Core Progress.
- [x] Pullout algorithm questions and automatically test them. You should also test in a file that is being selected 
  - [x] Markdown database.
- [x] Create a heatmap like overtime using the allowed charts
- [x] A Skill tree type strucutre which is useful for prioritizing and creating dependency for deck of cards and for books as well in general
  - [x] The deck of cards would inherit from an Class type
  - [x] I am thinking about a composite structure, where those who are not in the tree take random priority, and those who have more dependencies goes first
  - [x] Implement the system so that the cards with gigher priority are selected first, or the tree sees the agroupations and checks if everything (pre cached) caclculates which deck to select.
  - [x] This would actually be a smart way to make faster queries once I have way too many knowledge objects.
- [x] Image into Ascii
  - [x] As a tool
  - [x] As an automatic pattern ideal for terms images where no image is available. (Or you just want to preview 
  - [x] Report the progress results of 1 year ago, 1 month ago + 1 week ago + 1 day ago.
- [x] Serve as an organization extension for studying
- [x] Ability to Generate a terms through an collection of XLSX (Derivant of Concept Models)
- [x] Ability to create a grouper (inserts tags such as category or type to the collection of jsons it represents)

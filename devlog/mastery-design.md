Here a couple of ideas:


### Github Documentation of the code.

Building or having a quick link into adding important code in Github.

How do you even have that?
Like portfolio and stuff. My problems is that the applications I have are pretty bad, and then I have to ake like some weird edition on them to add a portfolio link. So what can it be done? Aside of me adding a task and completing it?



### Daily Challanges.

Perhaps to a simple youtube video indicating a challange to be completed.
However the problem with these is that those challanges requires of more mental work from my part to actually make it work. Having 3 of them.

Let me think...

How about if that is by itself a kind of category,



THen it would bring you to a link. And request with your OWN honesty to finish those challanges outside the link and then just report back how it was.

 Here is the idea:

 1. You complete your daily DSA
 2. Once is completed then it ask you repetedly if you want your daily TRUE damage challange.
 3. Which in this case is just the idea of doing something outside. Of course it requires internet or access to other applications such as ANki. if we are talking about a flashcards challange. And then just simply write a report on how it went. I would hwoever have a markdown report. that is being submitted and creating a blog on itself.

and then have a markdown in which to complete. and then that markdown shall be uploaded to a server or something like that into a paost gres.


### Daily Blog Reports


The idea is that it writes an comprehensible report in Markdown format automatically with all the problems, and your solutions during the day.


**Dependencies**

- Having the code from DSA being stored as a blob in the database. 
- Then also reporting back where is the DSA submission for that.

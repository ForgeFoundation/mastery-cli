{"elements":{"60":{"term":"cdn","example":"","description":"A content delivery network (CDN) is a group of geographically distributed servers that speed up the delivery of web content by bringing it closer to where users are. Data centers across the globe use caching, a process that temporarily stores copies of files, so that you can access internet content from a web-enabled device or browser more quickly through a server near you. CDNs cache content like web pages, images, and video in proxy servers near to your physical location. This allows you to do things like watch a movie, download software, check your bank balance, post on social media, or make purchases, without having to wait for content to load.

It receives information directly from users and displays incoming data to the user. Oddly enough, applications themselves do not reside at the application layer. Instead the layer facilitates communication through lower layers in order to establish connections with applications at the other end. Web browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) TelNet, and FTP, are examples of communications  that rely  on Layer 7. \n    Layer 6 - Presentation The Presentation Layer represents the area that is independent of data representation at the application layer. In general, it represents the preparation or translation of application format to network format, or from network formatting to application format. In other words, the layer “presents” data for the application or the network. A good example of this is encryption and decryption of data for secure transmission; this happens at Layer 6.\n     Layer 5 - Session When two computers or other networked devices need to speak with one another, a session needs to be created, and this is done at the Session Layer. Functions at this layer involve setup, coordination (how long should a system wait for a response, for example) and termination between the applications at each end of the session.","references":"","attachment":"","category":"network","prompt":"Descripbe an example of an app in one of the first 3 sessions:","priority":5,"slug":"application-presentation-session","formula_name":"application-presentation-session","attachment_is_url":false},"82":{"term":"Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical","example":"","description":"    Layer 4 – Transport The Transport Layer deals with the coordination of the data transfer between end systems and hosts. How much data to send, at what rate, where it goes, etc. The best known example of the Transport Layer is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is built on top of the Internet Protocol (IP), commonly known as TCP/IP. TCP and UDP port numbers work at Layer 4, while IP addresses work at Layer 3, the Network Layer. \n    Layer 3 - Network Here at the Network Layer is where you’ll find most of the router functionality that most networking professionals care about and love. In its most basic sense, this layer is responsible for packet forwarding, including routing through different routers. You might know that your Boston computer wants to connect to a server in California, but there are millions of different paths to take. Routers at this layer help do this efficiently. \n    Layer 2 – Data Link The Data Link Layer provides node-to-node data transfer (between two directly connected nodes), and also handles error correction from the physical layer. Two sublayers exist here as well--the Media Access Control (MAC) layer and the Logical Link Control (LLC) layer. In the networking world, most switches operate at Layer 2. But it’s not that simple. Some switches also operate at Layer 3 in order to support virtual LANs that may span more than one switch subnet, which requires routing capabilities. \n    Layer 1 - Physical At the bottom of our OSI model we have the Physical Layer, which represents the electrical and physical representation of the system. This can include everything from the cable type, radio frequency link (as in a Wi-Fi network), as well as the layout of pins, voltages, and other physical requirements. When a networking problem occurs, many networking pros go right to the physical layer to check that all of the cables are properly connected and that the power plug hasn’t been pulled from the router, switch or computer, for example.","references":"","attachment":"","category":"network","prompt":"Describe an example of an app in one of the first 3 sessions:","priority":5,"slug":"transport-network-data-link-physical","formula_name":"transport-network-data-link-physical","attachment_is_url":false},"139":{"term":"TCP UDP","example":"","description":"Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is connection-oriented, meaning once a connection has been established, data can be transmitted in two directions. TCP has built-in systems to check for errors and to guarantee data will be delivered in the order it was sent, making it the perfect protocol for transferring information like still images, data files, and web pages.\n        User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simpler, connectionless Internet protocol wherein error-checking and recovery services are not required. With UDP, there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, or terminating a connection; data is continuously sent to the recipient, whether or not they receive it.","references":"","attachment":"","category":"network","prompt":"When should you use TCP vs UDP?","priority":5,"slug":"tcp-udp","formula_name":"tcp-udp","attachment_is_url":false},"141":{"term":"Network Switch","example":"","description":"A network switch connects users, applications, and equipment across a network so that they can communicate with one another and share resources. The simplest network switches offer connectivity exclusively to devices on a single local-area network (LAN). More advanced switches can connect devices from multiple LANs and may even incorporate basic data security functions. \n        Network switches are used to allow communication and sharing of resources between multiple devices on a network. They help in forwarding data packets to their destination and improve network performance by reducing network congestion and network collisions. Additionally, switches provide network segmentation, which enhances network security, and support advanced networking features like Quality of Service (QoS) and VLANs.","references":"","attachment":"","category":"network","prompt":"Example of Network Switch equivalent in other than internet usage?","priority":5,"slug":"network-switch","formula_name":"network-switch","attachment_is_url":false},"181":{"term":"ttl","example":"","description":"Time to live (TTL) refers to the amount of time or “hops” that a packet is set to exist inside a network before being discarded by a router.

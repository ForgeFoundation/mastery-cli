Specifically, a measuring cup only has two measuring lines, a Low (L) line and a High (H) line. This means that these cups can't precisely measure and can only guarantee that the substance poured into them will be between the L and H line. For example, you might have a measuring cup that has a Low line at 400ml and a high line at 435ml. This means that when you use this measuring cup, you can only be sure that what you're measuring is between 400ml and 435ml.\r\n\r\nYou're given a list of measuring cups containing their low and high lines as well as one low integer and one high integer representing a range for a target measurement. Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether you can use the cups to accurately measure a volume in the specified [low, high] range (the range is inclusive).\r\n\r\nNote that:\r\n\r\n   - Each measuring cup will be represented by a pair of positive integers [L, H], where 0 <= L <= H.\r\n   - You'll always be given at least one measuring cup, and the low and high input parameters will always satisfy the following constraint: 0 <= low <= high.\r\n   - Once you've measured some liquid, it will immediately be transferred to a larger bowl that will eventually (possibly) contain the target measurement.\r\n   - You can't pour the contents of one measuring cup into another cup.\r\n\r\n## Sample Input\r\n\r\n``` \r\nmeasuringCups = [\r\n  [200, 210],\r\n  [450, 465],\r\n  [800, 850],\r\n] \r\nlow = 2100\r\nhigh = 2300\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sample Output\r\n\r\n``` \r\ntrue\r\n// We use cup [450, 465] to measure four volumes:\r\n// First measurement: Low = 450, High = 465\r\n// Second measurement: Low = 450 + 450 = 900, High = 465 + 465 = 930\r\n// Third measurement: Low = 900 + 450 = 1350, High = 930 + 465 = 1395\r\n// Fourth measurement: Low = 1350 + 450 = 1800, High = 1395 + 465 = 1860\r\n\r\n// Then we use cup [200, 210] to measure two volumes:\r\n// Fifth measurement: Low = 1800 + 200 = 2000, High = 1860 + 210 = 2070\r\n// Sixth measurement: Low = 2000 + 200 = 2200, High = 2070 + 210 = 2280\r\n\r\n// We've measured a volume in the range [2200, 2280].\r\n// This is within our target range, so we return `true`.\r\n\r\n// Note: there are other ways to measure a volume in the target range.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Hints\r\n\r\nHint 1\r\n> Start by considering the last cup that you'll use in your sequence of measurements. If it isn't possible to use any of the cups as the last cup, then you can't measure the desired volume.\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> If the cup that you're going to use last has a measuring range of [100, 110] and you want to measure in the range of [500, 550], then after you pick this cup as the last cup, you need to measure a range of [400, 440]. Now, you can simply pick the last cup you'll use to measure this new range. If you continue these steps, you'll eventually know if you're able to measure the entire range or not.\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> Hint #2 should give you an idea of how to solve this problem recursively. Try every cup as the last cup for the starting range, then recursively try to measure the new ranges created after using the selected last cups. If you ever reach a point where one cup can measure the entire range, then you're finished and you can measure the target range. Try to think of a way to optimize this recursive approach, since it might involve a lot of repeated calculations.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptimal Space & Time Complexity\r\nO(low * high * n) time | O(low * high) space - where n is the number of measuring cups\r\n```\r\n\r\n![solution](image.png)\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nAs we recursively call our canMeasureInRange function, we might realize that if the input low is ever less than or equal to 0, the outcome for that low is always the same.\r\n\r\nIn other words, checking if we can measure in the range [-10, 10] is equivalent to checking if we can measure in the range [-5, 10], which itself is equivalent to checking if we can measure in the range [0, 10].\r\n\r\nThe same logic applies to the high value.\r\n\r\nThus, we can optimize the solution described in the video explanation by capping the low and high values that we pass to our canMeasureInRange function to 0. This reduces the number of keys in our cache and maximizes cache hits, thereby optimizing our solution in practice (though not from a time-complexity point of view).\r\n\r\nThe two comments in the code snippet below highlight the changes that we've made to the code covered in the video explanation.\r\n\r\n``` \r\n// Change `<` to `<=`.\r\nif low <= 0 and high <= 0:\r\n    return False\r\n\r\ncanMeasure = False\r\nfor cup in measuringCups:\r\n    cupLow, cupHigh = cup\r\n    if low <= cupLow and cupHigh <= high:\r\n        canMeasure = True\r\n        break\r\n\r\n    // Cap the `newLow` and `newHigh` to 0.\r\n    newLow = max(0, low - cupLow)\r\n    newHigh = max(0, high - cupHigh)\r\n    canMeasure = canMeasureInRange(measuringCups, newLow, newHigh, memoization)\r\n    if canMeasure:\r\n        break\r\n```","basename":"ambiguous-measurements"},"average-of-levels-in-binary-tree":{"title":"Average of Levels in Binary Tree","description":"Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

The final words don't need to be in any particular order.\r\n\r\nA word is constructed in the boggle board by connecting adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) letters, without using any single letter at a given position more than once; while a word can of course have repeated letters, those repeated letters must come from different positions in the boggle board in order for the word to be contained in the board.

For the second part, what data structure lends itself very well to matching characters to multiple strings at once?\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> Try creating a trie out of the input list of words. This will allow you to compare letters in the boggle board against all input words in constant time. How can you efficiently traverse the boggle board to construct all potentially valid strings, without counting letters twice in any string?\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> Treat the board as a graph, where each element in the board is a node with up to 8 neighboring nodes. Traverse it in a depth-first-search-like fashion, checking if letters are contained in the trie and traversing the trie simultaneously if it makes sense to do so. How can you keep track of letters that you've already visited in order to avoid erroneously counting some of them twice in a single string? Could you keep track of visited nodes in an auxiliary data structure?\r\n\r\nHint 4\r\n> Keeping in mind that you only want to mark nodes as visited in a single branch of the graph that you're traversing (i.e., you don't want the state of visited nodes in one branch of the graph to spill into the state of another branch of the graph), try marking any node you traverse as unvisited at the end of the recursive call that actually traverses it, after traversing through all of the node's neighbors and performing the same actions on them recursively.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptimal Space & Time Complexity\r\nO(nm*8^s + ws) time | O(nm + ws) space - where n is the width the board, m is the height of the board, w is the number of words, and s is the length of the longest word\r\n```","basename":"boggle-board"},"breadth-first-search":{"title":"Breadth First Search","description":"AI Search Problem","tags":["medium","search","ai"],"preview":"### Description\r\n\r\n- uninformed search\r\n- adds neighbors in queue\r\n\r\n### Example 1\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven: \r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n        //   A____B____C\r\n        //   |   |   /\r\n        //   |   |  /\r\n        //   |   | /\r\n        //   D___E\r\n        //   |\\  |\r\n        //   | \\ |\r\n        //   |__\\|\r\n        //   F    G\r\n\r\n        const A = new Node('A', 0, 2);\r\n        const B = new Node('B', 1, 2);\r\n        const C = new Node('C', 2, 2);\r\n        const D = new Node('D', 0, 1);\r\n        const E = new Node('E', 1, 1);\r\n        const G = new Node('G', 0, 0);\r\n        const F = new Node('F', 1, 0);\r\n\r\n        const graph = new Graph();\r\n        graph.addEdge(A, B);\r\n        graph.addEdge(A, D);\r\n        graph.addEdge(B, C);\r\n        graph.addEdge(B, E);\r\n        graph.addEdge(C, E);\r\n        graph.addEdge(D, G);\r\n        graph.addEdge(D, F);\r\n        graph.addEdge(D, E);\r\n        graph.addEdge(D,  G);\r\n        graph.addEdge(E, G);\r\n        graph.addEdge(G, G);\r\n\r\n        const nodes = { A, B, C, D, E, G, F };\r\n        return { graph: graph, nodes: nodes };\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults in:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n{\r\n  path: [\r\n    Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 2 },\r\n    Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1 },\r\n    Node { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0 }\r\n  ],\r\n  cost: null,\r\n  count_searches: 6,\r\n  formatted_path: 'A -> D -> G',\r\n  exploration_path: [\r\n    Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 2 },\r\n    Node { id: 'B', x: 1, y: 2 },\r\n    Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1 },\r\n    Node { id: 'C', x: 2, y: 2 },\r\n    Node { id: 'E', x: 1, y: 1 },\r\n    Node { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0 }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould be able to find it it using breadth First Search.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### t_graph_1\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n        A----B\r\n       |  \\ | \\\r\n       D   \\|  H\r\n       |  \\ | /|\r\n       |    C  |\r\n        \\    \\ G\r\n         \\    /\r\n          \\  /\r\n           E\r\n           |\r\n           F\r\n\r\n\r\nconst A = new Node('A', 0, 1);\r\nconst B = new Node('B', 2, 1);\r\nconst C = new Node('C', 2, -1);\r\nconst D = new Node('D', 0, 0);\r\nconst E = new Node('E', 1, -5);\r\nconst F = new Node('F', 1, -2);\r\nconst G = new Node('G', 3, -2);\r\nconst H = new Node('H', 3, 0);\r\n\r\nconst nodes = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H};\r\n\r\n\r\nconst graph = new Graph();\r\ngraph.addEdge(A, B);\r\ngraph.addEdge(A, D);\r\ngraph.addEdge(A, C);\r\ngraph.addEdge(B, C);\r\ngraph.addEdge(B, H);\r\ngraph.addEdge(C, H);\r\ngraph.addEdge(C, G);\r\ngraph.addEdge(C, D);\r\ngraph.addEdge(D, E);\r\ngraph.addEdge(D, G);\r\ngraph.addEdge(E, G);\r\ngraph.addEdge(E, F);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n path: [\r\n    Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 1 },\r\n    Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 0 },\r\n    Node { id: 'E', x: 1, y: -5 },\r\n    Node { id: 'F', x: 1, y: -2 }\r\n  ],\r\n  cost: null,\r\n  count_searches: 8,\r\n  formatted_path: 'A -> D -> E -> F',\r\n  exploration_path: [\r\n    Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 1 },\r\n    Node { id: 'B', x: 2, y: 1 },\r\n    Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 0 },\r\n    Node { id: 'C', x: 2, y: -1 },\r\n    Node { id: 'H', x: 3, y: 0 },\r\n    Node { id: 'E', x: 1, y: -5 },\r\n    Node { id: 'G', x: 3, y: -2 },\r\n    Node { id: 'F', x: 1, y: -2 }\r\n  ]\r\n```","basename":"breadth-first-search"},"candy":{"title":"Candy","description":"Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.","tags":["hard","array"],"link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/","images":[],"hint":["https://wngnelson.com/assets/img_src/dsa/Candy.gif"],"preview":"### Description\r\n\r\nThere are n children standing in a line.

If there's an odd number of numbers in the set, as in {1, 3, 7}, the median is the number in the middle (3 in this case); if there's an even number of numbers in the set, as in {1, 3, 7, 8}, the median is the average of the two middle numbers ((3 + 7) / 2 == 5 in this case).\r\n\r\n## Sample Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\n// All operations below are performed sequentially.\r\nContinuousMedianHandler(): - // instantiate a ContinuousMedianHandler\r\ninsert(5): -\r\ninsert(10): -\r\ngetMedian(): 7.5\r\ninsert(100): -\r\ngetMedian(): 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Hints\r\n\r\nHint 1\r\n> The median of a set of numbers is often, by definition, one of the numbers in the set. Thus, you likely have to store all of the inserted numbers somewhere to be able to continuously compute their median.\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> The median of a set of numbers is either the middle number of that set (if the set has an odd amount of numbers) or the average of the middle numbers (if the set has an even amount of numbers). This means that if you could somehow keep track of the middle number(s) of the set of inserted numbers, you could easily compute the median by finding the indices of the middle numbers and doing some simple calculations. Perhaps storing all of the numbers in a sorted array could work, but what would be the runtime implication of inserting each new number into a sorted array?\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> Realizing that you only need to keep track of the middle numbers in the set of inserted numbers to compute the median, try keeping track of two subsets of the numbers: a max-heap of the lower half of the numbers and a min-heap of the greater half of the numbers. Any time you insert a number, pick the heap to place it in by comparing it to the max / min values of the heaps. Then, re-balance the heaps in an effort to keep their sizes apart by at most one. Doing so will allow you to access the middle number(s) of the set of inserted numbers very easily, which will make calculating the median a trivial computation. Re-balancing the heaps can be accomplished by simply removing a value from the larger heap and inserting it in the smaller one.

Can you think of a better way to do this?\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> To solve this problem optimally, you'll have to incrementally build valid strings by adding <div> and </div> tags to already valid partial strings. While doing this, you can avoid creating strings that will never lead to a valid final string by following two rules:\r\n>  - If a string has fewer opening tags than numberOfTags, it's valid to add an opening tag to the end of it.\r\n>  - If a string has fewer closing tags than opening tags, it's valid to add a closing tag to the end of it.\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> Using the rules defined in Hint #2, write a recursive algorithm that generates all possible valid strings. You'll need to keep track of how many opening and closing tags each partial string has available (at each recursive call), and you'll simply follow the rules outlined in Hint #2. Once a string has no more opening and closing tags available, you can add it to your final list of strings. Your first call to the function will start with an empty string as the partial string and with numberOfTags as the number of opening and closing tags available. For example, after you add an opening tag to a partial string, you'll recursively call the function like this: recursiveFunction(partialStringWithExtraOpeningTag, openingTags - 1,\r\nclosingTags)\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptimal Space & Time Complexity\r\nO((2n)!/((n!((n + 1)!)))) time | O((2n)!/((n!((n + 1)!)))) space - where n is the input number\r\n```\r\n\r\n![solution](time.png)","basename":"generate-div-tags"},"generate-parenthesis":{"title":"Generate Parentheses","description":"Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.","tags":["neetcode","medium","stack","backtracking"],"link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/","preview":"### Description\r\n\r\nGiven n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.\r\n\r\n### Example 1\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nInput: n = 3\r\nOutput: [\"((()))\",\"(()())\",\"(())()\",\"()(())\",\"()()()\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example 2\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nInput: n = 1\r\nOutput: [\"()\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Constraints:\r\n\r\n- 1 <= n <= 8","basename":"generate-parenthesis"},"graph-valid-tree":{"title":"Graph Valid Tree","description":"Return true if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and false otherwise.","tags":["medium","graph","graph-theory"],"link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/","images":[],"preview":"### Description\r\n\r\nYou have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.

It belongs to the family of local search algorithms and is often used in optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution from a set of possible solutions.\r\n\r\nIn Hill Climbing, the algorithm starts with an initial solution and then iteratively makes small changes to it in order to improve the solution. These changes are based on a heuristic function that evaluates the quality of the solution. The algorithm continues to make these small changes until it reaches a local maximum, meaning that no further improvement can be made with the current set of moves.\r\n\r\nHill Climbing can be useful in a variety of optimization problems, such as scheduling, route planning, and resource allocation. However, it has some limitations, such as the tendency to get stuck in local maxima and the lack of diversity in the search space. Therefore, it is often combined with other optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms or simulated annealing, to overcome these limitations and improve the search results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example 1\r\n\r\n\r\nGiven: \r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n        //   A____B____C\r\n        //   |   |   /\r\n        //   |   |  /\r\n        //   |   | /\r\n        //   D___E\r\n        //   |\\  |\r\n        //   | \\ |\r\n        //   |__\\|\r\n        //   F    G\r\n\r\n        const A = new Node('A', 0, 2);\r\n        const B = new Node('B', 1, 2);\r\n        const C = new Node('C', 2, 2);\r\n        const D = new Node('D', 0, 1);\r\n        const E = new Node('E', 1, 1);\r\n        const G = new Node('G', 0, 0);\r\n        const F = new Node('F', 1, 0);\r\n\r\n        const graph = new Graph();\r\n        graph.addEdge(A, B);\r\n        graph.addEdge(A, D);\r\n        graph.addEdge(B, C);\r\n        graph.addEdge(B, E);\r\n        graph.addEdge(C, E);\r\n        graph.addEdge(D, G);\r\n        graph.addEdge(D, F);\r\n        graph.addEdge(D, E);\r\n        graph.addEdge(D,  G);\r\n        graph.addEdge(E, G);\r\n        graph.addEdge(G, G);\r\n\r\n        const nodes = { A, B, C, D, E, G, F };\r\n        return { graph: graph, nodes: nodes };\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould be able to find it it using depth First Search.\r\n\r\nTraversal:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n______________________________________________\r\nResults from create_graph_5, Hill Climbing Search\r\nneighbors [\r\n  { id: 'B', x: 1, y: 2, heuristic: 3 },\r\n  { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1, heuristic: 1 }\r\n]\r\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1 }\r\nneighbors [\r\n  { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0, heuristic: 0 },\r\n  { id: 'F', x: 1, y: 0, heuristic: 1 },\r\n  { id: 'E', x: 1, y: 1, heuristic: 2 },\r\n  { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0, heuristic: 0 }\r\n]\r\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0 }\r\n{\r\n  path: [\r\n    Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 2 },\r\n    Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1 },\r\n    Node { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0 }\r\n  ],\r\n  cost: 3,\r\n  count_searches: 2,\r\n  formatted_path: 'A -> D -> G',\r\n  exploration_path: [ Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 2 }, Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1 } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### create_long_ass_graph\r\n\r\nHere it should get stuck, given a a local minima (despite following the right heurisitcs)\r\n\r\n\r\nHill climbing algorithm is a local search algorithm that can get stuck in a local maximum if the search space has many peaks and valleys, or if the heuristic function is not well-designed. When hill climbing gets stuck in a local maximum, it cannot find a better solution without backtracking to a previous state and exploring a different path.\r\n\r\nTherefore, backtracking is a technique commonly used to escape from local maxima in hill climbing. When the algorithm reaches a local maximum, it backtracks to a previous state and explores a different path. This process continues until the algorithm finds the global maximum or reaches a predefined stopping criterion.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all variants of hill climbing use backtracking. Some variants, such as Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search, use randomization or diversification to escape from local maxima. These variants may not backtrack but instead explore the search space in a more stochastic manner to avoid getting stuck in local maxima.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\n\r\nResults from create_long_ass_graph, Hill Climbing Search\r\n\r\nneighbors [\r\n  { id: 'B', x: 1, y: -1, 'heuristic (distance)': 14 },\r\n  { id: 'C', x: 1, y: 1, 'heuristic (distance)': 16 }\r\n]\r\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'B', x: 1, y: -1 }\r\nneighbors [\r\n  { id: 'D', x: 2, y: -2, 'heuristic (distance)': 12 },\r\n  { id: 'E', x: 2, y: 0, 'heuristic (distance)': 14 }\r\n]\r\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'D', x: 2, y: -2 }\r\nneighbors [\r\n  { id: 'H', x: 3, y: -1, 'heuristic (distance)': 12 },\r\n  { id: 'I', x: 3, y: 1, 'heuristic (distance)': 14 }\r\n]\r\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'H', x: 3, y: -1 }\r\nneighbors [\r\n  { id: 'P', x: 5, y: -5, 'heuristic (distance)': 6 },\r\n  { id: 'Q', x: 5, y: -3, 'heuristic (distance)': 8 }\r\n]\r\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'P', x: 5, y: -5 }\r\nneighbors [\r\n  { id: 'AF', x: 7, y: -1, 'heuristic (distance)': 8 },\r\n  { id: 'AG', x: 7, y: 1, 'heuristic (distance)': 10 }\r\n]\r\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'AF', x: 7, y: -1 }\r\nError: The algorithm got stuck and could not find a solution.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Note how the Hill Climbing Search gets stuck at the local Minimum, and does not backtrack to find the global minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### t_graph_1\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n        A----B\r\n       |  \\ | \\\r\n       D   \\|  H\r\n       |  \\ | /|\r\n       |    C  |\r\n        \\    \\ G\r\n         \\    /\r\n          \\  /\r\n           E\r\n           |\r\n           F\r\n\r\n\r\nconst A = new Node('A', 0, 1);\r\nconst B = new Node('B', 2, 1);\r\nconst C = new Node('C', 2, -1);\r\nconst D = new Node('D', 0, 0);\r\nconst E = new Node('E', 1, -5);\r\nconst F = new Node('F', 1, -6);\r\nconst G = new Node('G', 3, -2);\r\nconst H = new Node('H', 3, 0);\r\n\r\nconst nodes = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H};\r\n\r\n\r\nconst graph = new Graph();\r\ngraph.addEdge(A, B);\r\ngraph.addEdge(A, D);\r\ngraph.addEdge(A, C);\r\ngraph.addEdge(B, C);\r\ngraph.addEdge(B, H);\r\ngraph.addEdge(C, H);\r\ngraph.addEdge(C, G);\r\ngraph.addEdge(C, D);\r\ngraph.addEdge(D, E);\r\ngraph.addEdge(D, G);\r\ngraph.addEdge(E, G);\r\ngraph.addEdge(E, F);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected to fail, as the algorithm should get stuck with the local maximum at node C.

These time intervals are represented by pairs of integers [start, end], where 0 <= start < end. However, start and end don't represent real times; therefore, they may be greater than 24.\r\n\r\nNo two students can use a laptop at the same time, but immediately after a student is done using a laptop, another student can use that same laptop. For example, if one student rents a laptop during the time interval [0, 2], another student can rent the same laptop during any time interval starting with 2.\r\n\r\nWrite a function that returns the minimum number of laptops that the school needs to rent such that all students will always have access to a laptop when they need one.\r\n\r\n## Sample Input\r\n\r\n```\r\ntimes =\r\n    [\r\n    [0, 2],\r\n    [1, 4],\r\n    [4, 6],\r\n    [0, 4],\r\n    [7, 8],\r\n    [9, 11],\r\n    [3, 10],\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sample Output\r\n\r\n```\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Hints\r\n\r\nHint 1\r\n> There are many different ways to solve this problem, but only a few of them run in the optimal time. Can you come up with an algorithm that solves this problem in O(nlog(n)) time?\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> Suppose that you're given two time intervals: [s1, e1] and [s2, e2], where s1 < s2. If e1 <= s2, then the second time interval can use the same laptop as the first time interval.\r\n> One method to solve this problem with an optimal time complexity is to use a Min Heap. If you loop through time intervals that have been sorted by their start times and keep track of the smallest end time of time intervals for laptops that have already been rented out, you can determine how many laptops are required. Use the Min Heap to efficiency determine if any previous rental time intervals have ended as you loop through all the time intervals. If a rental time interval is done and another one starts after it, no extra laptop is required.\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> Another way to efficiently solve this problem is to realize that we don't need to know what start time corresponds with what end time. So long as we know all start times and all end times, we can determine the number of laptops required.\r\n\r\nHint 4\r\n> Start by creating two arrays—one for start times and one for end times—and sort them both in ascending order. We can simply loop through the start times and end times at the same time and compare the current start time to the current end time. If the current start time is greater than the current end time, then that means a laptop that was previously used is no longer being used and can be given to the student renting a laptop at this starting time. Thus, we can increment both our start-time and end-time pointers and continue without needing an additional laptop. If the current start time is smaller than the current end time, then another rental has started before a previous rental has ended, and we thus require another laptop, so we increment the start pointer and a variable keeping track of the number of laptops required.

Let the rows of the array represent substrings of the second input string str2. Let the first row represent the empty string.

Let the columns similarly represent the first input string str1.\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> Build up the array mentioned in Hint #1 one row at a time. In other words, find the longest common subsequences for all the substrings of str1 represented by the columns and the empty string represented by the first row, then for all the substrings of str1 represented by the columns and the first letter of str2 represented by the second row, etc., until you compare both full strings. Find a formula that relates the longest common subsequence at any given point to previous subsequences.\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> Do you really need to build and store subsequences at each point in the two-dimensional array mentioned in Hint #1? Try storing booleans to determine whether or not a letter at a given point in the two-dimensional array is part of the longest common subsequence as well as pointers to determine what should come before this letter in the final subsequence.

When considering submatrices of any size larger than 1, it's almost always the case that some these matrices will have overlapping elements, meaning that we'll repeatedly add up the same numbers. If we were to use the brute-force approach, we would get a time complexity of O(width * height * size). To achieve a more optimal time complexity, we need to avoid readding elements that have already been added. Can you think of a way to solve this problem in O(width * height) time?\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> To avoid doing repeated addition, we have to use auxiliary space. Ideally, this extra space will allow us to determine the sum of a submatrix of any size in constant time. Start by creating a matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix (we call this matrix sums). The element at position i, j (where i is the row and j is the column) in this new matrix should be the sum of all the elements in the submatrix whose top left corner is at 0, 0 and whose bottom right corner is at i, j. How can you quickly fill up this new matrix, and how can you then use it to determine the sum of a submatrix of any size in constant time?\r\n\r\nHint 4\r\n> The sum of a matrix whose bottom right corner is at i, j (where size <= i <= j) is simply sums[i][j] - sums[i - size][j] - sums[i][j - size] + sums[i - size][j - size]. See the Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation for a more in-depth explanation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptimal Space & Time Complexity\r\nO(w * h) time | O(w * h) space - where w is the width of the matrix and h is the height\r\n```","basename":"maximum-sum-submatrix"},"maximum-value-of-k-coins-from-piles":{"title":"Maximum Value of K Coins From Piles","description":"In one move, you can choose any coin on top of any pile, remove it, and add it to your wallet.","tags":["hard","dp","general-1d"],"link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-value-of-k-coins-from-piles","images":[],"preview":"### Description\r\n\r\nThere are n piles of coins on a table.

However, if you reach a student with a smaller score than the previous student's score, you'll have to backtrack through the array to fix previous reward assignments. During this backtrack, is it correct to simply increment the reward of a student whose score is greater than the next student's score?\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> Notice that there are local mins and local maxes in the input list of scores: scores that are smaller than both scores next to them and scores that are greater than both scores next to them. Find the local mins, and try expanding away from them until you reach local maxes, assigning (and incrementing) rewards as you go.\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> Do you actually need to find the local mins mentioned in Hint #2?

Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether you can use the cups to accurately measure a volume in the specified [low, high] range (the range is inclusive).\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that:\\r\\n\\r\\n   - Each measuring cup will be represented by a pair of positive integers [L, H], where 0 <= L <= H.\\r\\n   - You'll always be given at least one measuring cup, and the low and high input parameters will always satisfy the following constraint: 0 <= low <= high.\\r\\n   - Once you've measured some liquid, it will immediately be transferred to a larger bowl that will eventually (possibly) contain the target measurement.\\r\\n   - You can't pour the contents of one measuring cup into another cup.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Sample Input\\r\\n\\r\\n``` \\r\\nmeasuringCups = [\\r\\n  [200, 210],\\r\\n  [450, 465],\\r\\n  [800, 850],\\r\\n] \\r\\nlow = 2100\\r\\nhigh = 2300\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Sample Output\\r\\n\\r\\n``` \\r\\ntrue\\r\\n// We use cup [450, 465] to measure four volumes:\\r\\n// First measurement: Low = 450, High = 465\\r\\n// Second measurement: Low = 450 + 450 = 900, High = 465 + 465 = 930\\r\\n// Third measurement: Low = 900 + 450 = 1350, High = 930 + 465 = 1395\\r\\n// Fourth measurement: Low = 1350 + 450 = 1800, High = 1395 + 465 = 1860\\r\\n\\r\\n// Then we use cup [200, 210] to measure two volumes:\\r\\n// Fifth measurement: Low = 1800 + 200 = 2000, High = 1860 + 210 = 2070\\r\\n// Sixth measurement: Low = 2000 + 200 = 2200, High = 2070 + 210 = 2280\\r\\n\\r\\n// We've measured a volume in the range [2200, 2280].\\r\\n// This is within our target range, so we return `true`.\\r\\n\\r\\n// Note: there are other ways to measure a volume in the target range.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Hints\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 1\\r\\n> Start by considering the last cup that you'll use in your sequence of measurements. If it isn't possible to use any of the cups as the last cup, then you can't measure the desired volume.\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 2\\r\\n> If the cup that you're going to use last has a measuring range of [100, 110] and you want to measure in the range of [500, 550], then after you pick this cup as the last cup, you need to measure a range of [400, 440]. Now, you can simply pick the last cup you'll use to measure this new range. If you continue these steps, you'll eventually know if you're able to measure the entire range or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 3\\r\\n> Hint #2 should give you an idea of how to solve this problem recursively. Try every cup as the last cup for the starting range, then recursively try to measure the new ranges created after using the selected last cups. If you ever reach a point where one cup can measure the entire range, then you're finished and you can measure the target range. Try to think of a way to optimize this recursive approach, since it might involve a lot of repeated calculations.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nOptimal Space & Time Complexity\\r\\nO(low * high * n) time | O(low * high) space - where n is the number of measuring cups\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n![solution](image.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Notes\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we recursively call our canMeasureInRange function, we might realize that if the input low is ever less than or equal to 0, the outcome for that low is always the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn other words, checking if we can measure in the range [-10, 10] is equivalent to checking if we can measure in the range [-5, 10], which itself is equivalent to checking if we can measure in the range [0, 10].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same logic applies to the high value.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, we can optimize the solution described in the video explanation by capping the low and high values that we pass to our canMeasureInRange function to 0. This reduces the number of keys in our cache and maximizes cache hits, thereby optimizing our solution in practice (though not from a time-complexity point of view).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two comments in the code snippet below highlight the changes that we've made to the code covered in the video explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\n``` \\r\\n// Change `<` to `<=`.\\r\\nif low <= 0 and high <= 0:\\r\\n    return False\\r\\n\\r\\ncanMeasure = False\\r\\nfor cup in measuringCups:\\r\\n    cupLow, cupHigh = cup\\r\\n    if low <= cupLow and cupHigh <= high:\\r\\n        canMeasure = True\\r\\n        break\\r\\n\\r\\n    // Cap the `newLow` and `newHigh` to 0.\\r\\n    newLow = max(0, low - cupLow)\\r\\n    newHigh = max(0, high - cupHigh)\\r\\n    canMeasure = canMeasureInRange(measuringCups, newLow, newHigh, memoization)\\r\\n    if canMeasure:\\r\\n        break\\r\\n```\",\"basename\":\"ambiguous-measurements\"},\"average-of-levels-in-binary-tree\":{\"title\":\"Average of Levels in Binary Tree\",\"description\":\"Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

For the second part, what data structure lends itself very well to matching characters to multiple strings at once?\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 2\\r\\n> Try creating a trie out of the input list of words. This will allow you to compare letters in the boggle board against all input words in constant time. How can you efficiently traverse the boggle board to construct all potentially valid strings, without counting letters twice in any string?\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 3\\r\\n> Treat the board as a graph, where each element in the board is a node with up to 8 neighboring nodes. Traverse it in a depth-first-search-like fashion, checking if letters are contained in the trie and traversing the trie simultaneously if it makes sense to do so. How can you keep track of letters that you've already visited in order to avoid erroneously counting some of them twice in a single string? Could you keep track of visited nodes in an auxiliary data structure?\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 4\\r\\n> Keeping in mind that you only want to mark nodes as visited in a single branch of the graph that you're traversing (i.e., you don't want the state of visited nodes in one branch of the graph to spill into the state of another branch of the graph), try marking any node you traverse as unvisited at the end of the recursive call that actually traverses it, after traversing through all of the node's neighbors and performing the same actions on them recursively.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nOptimal Space & Time Complexity\\r\\nO(nm*8^s + ws) time | O(nm + ws) space - where n is the width the board, m is the height of the board, w is the number of words, and s is the length of the longest word\\r\\n```\",\"basename\":\"boggle-board\"},\"breadth-first-search\":{\"title\":\"Breadth First Search\",\"description\":\"AI Search Problem\",\"tags\":[\"medium\",\"search\",\"ai\"],\"preview\":\"### Description\\r\\n\\r\\n- uninformed search\\r\\n- adds neighbors in queue\\r\\n\\r\\n### Example 1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven: \\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n\\r\\n        //   A____B____C\\r\\n        //   |   |   /\\r\\n        //   |   |  /\\r\\n        //   |   | /\\r\\n        //   D___E\\r\\n        //   |\\\\  |\\r\\n        //   | \\\\ |\\r\\n        //   |__\\\\|\\r\\n        //   F    G\\r\\n\\r\\n        const A = new Node('A', 0, 2);\\r\\n        const B = new Node('B', 1, 2);\\r\\n        const C = new Node('C', 2, 2);\\r\\n        const D = new Node('D', 0, 1);\\r\\n        const E = new Node('E', 1, 1);\\r\\n        const G = new Node('G', 0, 0);\\r\\n        const F = new Node('F', 1, 0);\\r\\n\\r\\n        const graph = new Graph();\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(A, B);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(A, D);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(B, C);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(B, E);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(C, E);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(D, G);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(D, F);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(D, E);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(D,  G);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(E, G);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(G, G);\\r\\n\\r\\n        const nodes = { A, B, C, D, E, G, F };\\r\\n        return { graph: graph, nodes: nodes };\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nResults in:\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n{\\r\\n  path: [\\r\\n    Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 2 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0 }\\r\\n  ],\\r\\n  cost: null,\\r\\n  count_searches: 6,\\r\\n  formatted_path: 'A -> D -> G',\\r\\n  exploration_path: [\\r\\n    Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 2 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'B', x: 1, y: 2 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'C', x: 2, y: 2 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'E', x: 1, y: 1 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0 }\\r\\n  ]\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nShould be able to find it it using breadth First Search.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### t_graph_1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n        A----B\\r\\n       |  \\\\ | \\\\\\r\\n       D   \\\\|  H\\r\\n       |  \\\\ | /|\\r\\n       |    C  |\\r\\n        \\\\    \\\\ G\\r\\n         \\\\    /\\r\\n          \\\\  /\\r\\n           E\\r\\n           |\\r\\n           F\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nconst A = new Node('A', 0, 1);\\r\\nconst B = new Node('B', 2, 1);\\r\\nconst C = new Node('C', 2, -1);\\r\\nconst D = new Node('D', 0, 0);\\r\\nconst E = new Node('E', 1, -5);\\r\\nconst F = new Node('F', 1, -2);\\r\\nconst G = new Node('G', 3, -2);\\r\\nconst H = new Node('H', 3, 0);\\r\\n\\r\\nconst nodes = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H};\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nconst graph = new Graph();\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(A, B);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(A, D);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(A, C);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(B, C);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(B, H);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(C, H);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(C, G);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(C, D);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(D, E);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(D, G);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(E, G);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(E, F);\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\n path: [\\r\\n    Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 1 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 0 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'E', x: 1, y: -5 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'F', x: 1, y: -2 }\\r\\n  ],\\r\\n  cost: null,\\r\\n  count_searches: 8,\\r\\n  formatted_path: 'A -> D -> E -> F',\\r\\n  exploration_path: [\\r\\n    Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 1 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'B', x: 2, y: 1 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 0 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'C', x: 2, y: -1 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'H', x: 3, y: 0 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'E', x: 1, y: -5 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'G', x: 3, y: -2 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'F', x: 1, y: -2 }\\r\\n  ]\\r\\n```\",\"basename\":\"breadth-first-search\"},\"candy\":{\"title\":\"Candy\",\"description\":\"Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.\",\"tags\":[\"hard\",\"array\"],\"link\":\"https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/\",\"images\":[],\"hint\":[\"https://wngnelson.com/assets/img_src/dsa/Candy.gif\"],\"preview\":\"### Description\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are n children standing in a line.

This means that if you could somehow keep track of the middle number(s) of the set of inserted numbers, you could easily compute the median by finding the indices of the middle numbers and doing some simple calculations. Perhaps storing all of the numbers in a sorted array could work, but what would be the runtime implication of inserting each new number into a sorted array?\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 3\\r\\n> Realizing that you only need to keep track of the middle numbers in the set of inserted numbers to compute the median, try keeping track of two subsets of the numbers: a max-heap of the lower half of the numbers and a min-heap of the greater half of the numbers. Any time you insert a number, pick the heap to place it in by comparing it to the max / min values of the heaps. Then, re-balance the heaps in an effort to keep their sizes apart by at most one. Doing so will allow you to access the middle number(s) of the set of inserted numbers very easily, which will make calculating the median a trivial computation. Re-balancing the heaps can be accomplished by simply removing a value from the larger heap and inserting it in the smaller one.

Can you think of a better way to do this?\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 2\\r\\n> To solve this problem optimally, you'll have to incrementally build valid strings by adding <div> and </div> tags to already valid partial strings. While doing this, you can avoid creating strings that will never lead to a valid final string by following two rules:\\r\\n>  - If a string has fewer opening tags than numberOfTags, it's valid to add an opening tag to the end of it.\\r\\n>  - If a string has fewer closing tags than opening tags, it's valid to add a closing tag to the end of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 3\\r\\n> Using the rules defined in Hint #2, write a recursive algorithm that generates all possible valid strings. You'll need to keep track of how many opening and closing tags each partial string has available (at each recursive call), and you'll simply follow the rules outlined in Hint #2. Once a string has no more opening and closing tags available, you can add it to your final list of strings. Your first call to the function will start with an empty string as the partial string and with numberOfTags as the number of opening and closing tags available. For example, after you add an opening tag to a partial string, you'll recursively call the function like this: recursiveFunction(partialStringWithExtraOpeningTag, openingTags - 1,\\r\\nclosingTags)\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nOptimal Space & Time Complexity\\r\\nO((2n)!/((n!((n + 1)!)))) time | O((2n)!/((n!((n + 1)!)))) space - where n is the input number\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n![solution](time.png)\",\"basename\":\"generate-div-tags\"},\"generate-parenthesis\":{\"title\":\"Generate Parentheses\",\"description\":\"Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.\",\"tags\":[\"neetcode\",\"medium\",\"stack\",\"backtracking\"],\"link\":\"https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/\",\"preview\":\"### Description\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Example 1\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nInput: n = 3\\r\\nOutput: [\\\"((()))\\\",\\\"(()())\\\",\\\"(())()\\\",\\\"()(())\\\",\\\"()()()\\\"]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Example 2\\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nInput: n = 1\\r\\nOutput: [\\\"()\\\"]\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Constraints:\\r\\n\\r\\n- 1 <= n <= 8\",\"basename\":\"generate-parenthesis\"},\"graph-valid-tree\":{\"title\":\"Graph Valid Tree\",\"description\":\"Return true if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and false otherwise.\",\"tags\":[\"medium\",\"graph\",\"graph-theory\"],\"link\":\"https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/\",\"images\":[],\"preview\":\"### Description\\r\\n\\r\\nYou have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.

It belongs to the family of local search algorithms and is often used in optimization problems where the goal is to find the best solution from a set of possible solutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Hill Climbing, the algorithm starts with an initial solution and then iteratively makes small changes to it in order to improve the solution. These changes are based on a heuristic function that evaluates the quality of the solution. The algorithm continues to make these small changes until it reaches a local maximum, meaning that no further improvement can be made with the current set of moves.\\r\\n\\r\\nHill Climbing can be useful in a variety of optimization problems, such as scheduling, route planning, and resource allocation. However, it has some limitations, such as the tendency to get stuck in local maxima and the lack of diversity in the search space. Therefore, it is often combined with other optimization techniques, such as genetic algorithms or simulated annealing, to overcome these limitations and improve the search results.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Example 1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n\\r\\n        //   A____B____C\\r\\n        //   |   |   /\\r\\n        //   |   |  /\\r\\n        //   |   | /\\r\\n        //   D___E\\r\\n        //   |\\\\  |\\r\\n        //   | \\\\ |\\r\\n        //   |__\\\\|\\r\\n        //   F    G\\r\\n\\r\\n        const A = new Node('A', 0, 2);\\r\\n        const B = new Node('B', 1, 2);\\r\\n        const C = new Node('C', 2, 2);\\r\\n        const D = new Node('D', 0, 1);\\r\\n        const E = new Node('E', 1, 1);\\r\\n        const G = new Node('G', 0, 0);\\r\\n        const F = new Node('F', 1, 0);\\r\\n\\r\\n        const graph = new Graph();\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(A, B);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(A, D);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(B, C);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(B, E);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(C, E);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(D, G);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(D, F);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(D, E);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(D,  G);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(E, G);\\r\\n        graph.addEdge(G, G);\\r\\n\\r\\n        const nodes = { A, B, C, D, E, G, F };\\r\\n        return { graph: graph, nodes: nodes };\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nShould be able to find it it using depth First Search.\\r\\n\\r\\nTraversal:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n______________________________________________\\r\\nResults from create_graph_5, Hill Climbing Search\\r\\nneighbors [\\r\\n  { id: 'B', x: 1, y: 2, heuristic: 3 },\\r\\n  { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1, heuristic: 1 }\\r\\n]\\r\\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1 }\\r\\nneighbors [\\r\\n  { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0, heuristic: 0 },\\r\\n  { id: 'F', x: 1, y: 0, heuristic: 1 },\\r\\n  { id: 'E', x: 1, y: 1, heuristic: 2 },\\r\\n  { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0, heuristic: 0 }\\r\\n]\\r\\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0 }\\r\\n{\\r\\n  path: [\\r\\n    Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 2 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1 },\\r\\n    Node { id: 'G', x: 0, y: 0 }\\r\\n  ],\\r\\n  cost: 3,\\r\\n  count_searches: 2,\\r\\n  formatted_path: 'A -> D -> G',\\r\\n  exploration_path: [ Node { id: 'A', x: 0, y: 2 }, Node { id: 'D', x: 0, y: 1 } ]\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### create_long_ass_graph\\r\\n\\r\\nHere it should get stuck, given a a local minima (despite following the right heurisitcs)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHill climbing algorithm is a local search algorithm that can get stuck in a local maximum if the search space has many peaks and valleys, or if the heuristic function is not well-designed. When hill climbing gets stuck in a local maximum, it cannot find a better solution without backtracking to a previous state and exploring a different path.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, backtracking is a technique commonly used to escape from local maxima in hill climbing. When the algorithm reaches a local maximum, it backtracks to a previous state and explores a different path. This process continues until the algorithm finds the global maximum or reaches a predefined stopping criterion.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, not all variants of hill climbing use backtracking. Some variants, such as Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search, use randomization or diversification to escape from local maxima. These variants may not backtrack but instead explore the search space in a more stochastic manner to avoid getting stuck in local maxima.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n\\r\\n______________________________________________\\r\\n\\r\\nResults from create_long_ass_graph, Hill Climbing Search\\r\\n\\r\\nneighbors [\\r\\n  { id: 'B', x: 1, y: -1, 'heuristic (distance)': 14 },\\r\\n  { id: 'C', x: 1, y: 1, 'heuristic (distance)': 16 }\\r\\n]\\r\\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'B', x: 1, y: -1 }\\r\\nneighbors [\\r\\n  { id: 'D', x: 2, y: -2, 'heuristic (distance)': 12 },\\r\\n  { id: 'E', x: 2, y: 0, 'heuristic (distance)': 14 }\\r\\n]\\r\\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'D', x: 2, y: -2 }\\r\\nneighbors [\\r\\n  { id: 'H', x: 3, y: -1, 'heuristic (distance)': 12 },\\r\\n  { id: 'I', x: 3, y: 1, 'heuristic (distance)': 14 }\\r\\n]\\r\\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'H', x: 3, y: -1 }\\r\\nneighbors [\\r\\n  { id: 'P', x: 5, y: -5, 'heuristic (distance)': 6 },\\r\\n  { id: 'Q', x: 5, y: -3, 'heuristic (distance)': 8 }\\r\\n]\\r\\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'P', x: 5, y: -5 }\\r\\nneighbors [\\r\\n  { id: 'AF', x: 7, y: -1, 'heuristic (distance)': 8 },\\r\\n  { id: 'AG', x: 7, y: 1, 'heuristic (distance)': 10 }\\r\\n]\\r\\nbestNext selected:  Node { id: 'AF', x: 7, y: -1 }\\r\\nError: The algorithm got stuck and could not find a solution.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n> Note how the Hill Climbing Search gets stuck at the local Minimum, and does not backtrack to find the global minimum.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### t_graph_1\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n        A----B\\r\\n       |  \\\\ | \\\\\\r\\n       D   \\\\|  H\\r\\n       |  \\\\ | /|\\r\\n       |    C  |\\r\\n        \\\\    \\\\ G\\r\\n         \\\\    /\\r\\n          \\\\  /\\r\\n           E\\r\\n           |\\r\\n           F\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nconst A = new Node('A', 0, 1);\\r\\nconst B = new Node('B', 2, 1);\\r\\nconst C = new Node('C', 2, -1);\\r\\nconst D = new Node('D', 0, 0);\\r\\nconst E = new Node('E', 1, -5);\\r\\nconst F = new Node('F', 1, -6);\\r\\nconst G = new Node('G', 3, -2);\\r\\nconst H = new Node('H', 3, 0);\\r\\n\\r\\nconst nodes = {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H};\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nconst graph = new Graph();\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(A, B);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(A, D);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(A, C);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(B, C);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(B, H);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(C, H);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(C, G);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(C, D);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(D, E);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(D, G);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(E, G);\\r\\ngraph.addEdge(E, F);\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExpected to fail, as the algorithm should get stuck with the local maximum at node C.

Can you come up with an algorithm that solves this problem in O(nlog(n)) time?\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 2\\r\\n> Suppose that you're given two time intervals: [s1, e1] and [s2, e2], where s1 < s2. If e1 <= s2, then the second time interval can use the same laptop as the first time interval.\\r\\n> One method to solve this problem with an optimal time complexity is to use a Min Heap. If you loop through time intervals that have been sorted by their start times and keep track of the smallest end time of time intervals for laptops that have already been rented out, you can determine how many laptops are required. Use the Min Heap to efficiency determine if any previous rental time intervals have ended as you loop through all the time intervals. If a rental time interval is done and another one starts after it, no extra laptop is required.\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 3\\r\\n> Another way to efficiently solve this problem is to realize that we don't need to know what start time corresponds with what end time. So long as we know all start times and all end times, we can determine the number of laptops required.\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 4\\r\\n> Start by creating two arrays—one for start times and one for end times—and sort them both in ascending order. We can simply loop through the start times and end times at the same time and compare the current start time to the current end time. If the current start time is greater than the current end time, then that means a laptop that was previously used is no longer being used and can be given to the student renting a laptop at this starting time. Thus, we can increment both our start-time and end-time pointers and continue without needing an additional laptop. If the current start time is smaller than the current end time, then another rental has started before a previous rental has ended, and we thus require another laptop, so we increment the start pointer and a variable keeping track of the number of laptops required.

This approach is acceptable, but it isn't optimal. Why isn't it optimal?\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 2\\r\\n> The approach stated in Hint #1 isn't optimal because it repeats some additions. When considering submatrices of any size larger than 1, it's almost always the case that some these matrices will have overlapping elements, meaning that we'll repeatedly add up the same numbers. If we were to use the brute-force approach, we would get a time complexity of O(width * height * size). To achieve a more optimal time complexity, we need to avoid readding elements that have already been added. Can you think of a way to solve this problem in O(width * height) time?\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 3\\r\\n> To avoid doing repeated addition, we have to use auxiliary space. Ideally, this extra space will allow us to determine the sum of a submatrix of any size in constant time. Start by creating a matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix (we call this matrix sums). The element at position i, j (where i is the row and j is the column) in this new matrix should be the sum of all the elements in the submatrix whose top left corner is at 0, 0 and whose bottom right corner is at i, j. How can you quickly fill up this new matrix, and how can you then use it to determine the sum of a submatrix of any size in constant time?\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 4\\r\\n> The sum of a matrix whose bottom right corner is at i, j (where size <= i <= j) is simply sums[i][j] - sums[i - size][j] - sums[i][j - size] + sums[i - size][j - size].

Unlike with a normal sorted array however, you cannot simply find the middle number of the array and compare it to the target here, because the shift could lead you in the wrong direction. Instead, realize that whenever you find the middle number in the array, the following two scenarios are possible (assuming the middle number is not equal to the target number, in which case you're done): either the left-pointer number is smaller than or equal to the middle number, or it is bigger. Figure out a way to eliminate half of the array depending on the scenario.\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 2\\r\\n> In the scenario where the left-pointer number is smaller than or equal to the middle number, two other scenarios can arise: either the target number is smaller than the middle number and greater than or equal to the left-pointer number, or it's not. In the first scenario, the right half of the array can be eliminated; in the second scenario, the left half can be eliminated. Figure out the scenarios that can arise if the left-pointer number is greater than the middle number and apply whatever logic you come up with recursively until you find the target number or until you run out of numbers in the array.\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 3\\r\\n> Can you implement this algorithm iteratively?

The issue with this approach is that there are 9^81 possible 9x9 Sudoku boards. This is an extremely large number, which makes it practically impossible to take this approach. How can you avoid generating every possible Sudoku board?\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 2\\r\\n> Keep in mind that a Sudoku board doesn't need to be entirely filled to figure out if it's invalid and won't lead to a solution. Try generating partially filled Sudoku boards until they become invalid, thereby abandoning solutions that will never lead to a properly solved board.\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 3\\r\\n> The method described in Hint #2 is more formally known as backtracking. This involves attempting to place digits into empty positions in the Sudoku board and checking at each insertion if that newly inserted digit makes the Sudoku board invalid. If it does, then you try to insert another digit until you find one that doesn't invalidate the board. If it doesn't invalidate the board, you temporarily place that digit and continue to try to solve the rest of the board. If you ever reach a position where there are no valid digits to be inserted (every digit placed in that position leads to an invalid board), that means that one of the previously inserted digits is incorrect. Thus, you must backtrack and change previously placed digits. For more details on this approach, refer to the Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation.\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nOptimal Space & Time Complexity\\r\\nO(1) time | O(1) space - assuming a 9x9 input board\\r\\n```\",\"basename\":\"solve-sudoku\"},\"solving-questions-with-brainpower\":{\"title\":\"Solve Questions with Brainpower\",\"description\":\"You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array questions where questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri].\",\"tags\":[\"medium\",\"general-1d\",\"dp\"],\"link\":\"https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower\",\"images\":[],\"preview\":\"### Description\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array questions where questions[i] = [pointsi, brainpoweri].\\r\\n\\r\\nThe array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order (i.e., starting from question 0) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question.

Starting at a random job, traverse its prerequisite jobs in Depth-first Search fashion until you reach a job with no prerequisites; such a job can safely be appended to the final order. Once you've traversed and added all prerequisites of a job to the final order, you can append the job in question to the order. This approach will have to track whether nodes have been traversed already, whether they're in the process of being traversed (which would indicate a cycle in the graph and therefore no valid topological order), or whether they're ready to be traversed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHint 3\\r\\n> Another approach to solving this problem is to traverse the graph mentioned in Hint #1 starting specifically with jobs that have no prerequisites. Keep track of all the jobs that have no prerequisites, traverse them one by one, and append them to the final order. For all of these jobs, remove their dependencies from the graph and update the number of prerequisites for each of these dependencies accordingly (these dependencies should now have one prerequisite less since one of their prerequisite job has just been added to the final order). As you update the number of prerequisites for these other jobs, keep track of the ones that no longer have prerequisites and that are ready to be traversed. You'll eventually go through all of the jobs if there are no cycles in the graph. If there is a cycle in the graph, there will still be jobs with prerequisites and you'll know that there is no valid topological order.

Since you're looking for a descendant and an ancestor, simply check if nodeOne is a descendant of nodeTwo, and if it is, then check if nodeThree is an ancestor of nodeTwo. If the previous checks come out negative, check if nodeThree is a descendant of nodeTwo, and if it is, then check if nodeOne is an ancestor of nodeTwo.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nHint 3\\r\\nAlthough the approach mentioned in Hint #2 is fairly efficient (it runs in O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree), there's a way to solve this problem faster. It involves realizing that, when searching for nodeTwo from either nodeOne or nodeThree, if you ever reach nodeThree from nodeOne or nodeOne from nodeThree before reaching nodeTwo, then you can immediately stop the algorithm, because nodeTwo cannot be between these nodes.

Note that you're not allowed to construct any BSTs in your code.\r\n\r\nA BST is a Binary Tree that consists only of BST nodes. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null.\r\n\r\n## Sample Input\r\n\r\n```\r\narrayOne = [10, 15, 8, 12, 94, 81, 5, 2, 11]\r\narrayTwo = [10, 8, 5, 15, 2, 12, 11, 94, 81]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sample Output\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrue // both arrays represent the BST below\r\n         10\r\n       /     \\\r\n      8      15\r\n    /       /   \\\r\n   5      12    94\r\n /       /     /\r\n2       11    81\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Hints\r\n\r\nHint 1\r\n> You can immediately conclude that the input arrays don't represent the same BST if their first values aren't equal to each other, since their first values represent the root of the BST.

If the first values of the arrays aren't equal to each other or if the arrays don't have the same length, the arrays don't represent the same BST. If the first values and lengths are equal to each other, respectively, perform the following actions on both arrays: gather all integers that are smaller than the first integer; these form a new array that represents the left subtree of the relevant BST; gather all integers that are greater than or equal to the first integer; these form a new array that represents the right subtree of the relevant BST. Call the recursive function twice: once with the two left-subtree arrays and once with the two right-subtree arrays.\r\n\r\nHint 4\r\n> Do you actually need to create all of the auxiliary arrays

The caveat is that the integers in the array have been shifted by some amount; in other words, they've been moved to the left or to the right by one or more positions. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4] might have turned into [3, 4, 1, 2].\r\n\r\nThe function should use a variation of the Binary Search algorithm to determine if the target integer is contained in the array and should return its index if it is, otherwise -1.\r\n\r\nIf you're unfamiliar with Binary Search, we recommend watching the Conceptual Overview section of the Binary Search question's video explanation before starting to code.\r\n\r\n## Sample Input\r\n\r\n```\r\narray = [45, 61, 71, 72, 73, 0, 1, 21, 33, 37]\r\ntarget = 33\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sample Output\r\n\r\n```\r\n8\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Hints\r\n\r\nHint 1\r\n> The Binary Search algorithm involves a left pointer and a right pointer and using those pointers to find the middle number in an array. Unlike with a normal sorted array however, you cannot simply find the middle number of the array and compare it to the target here, because the shift could lead you in the wrong direction. Instead, realize that whenever you find the middle number in the array, the following two scenarios are possible (assuming the middle number is not equal to the target number, in which case you're done): either the left-pointer number is smaller than or equal to the middle number, or it is bigger. Figure out a way to eliminate half of the array depending on the scenario.\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> In the scenario where the left-pointer number is smaller than or equal to the middle number, two other scenarios can arise: either the target number is smaller than the middle number and greater than or equal to the left-pointer number, or it's not. In the first scenario, the right half of the array can be eliminated; in the second scenario, the left half can be eliminated. Figure out the scenarios that can arise if the left-pointer number is greater than the middle number and apply whatever logic you come up with recursively until you find the target number or until you run out of numbers in the array.\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> Can you implement this algorithm iteratively?

The sample array in the video, which has a repeated 45, happens to work fine, but this is an exception—not the rule.\r\n\r\nTo understand why the numbers must be distinct, consider the following inputs:\r\n\r\n```\r\narray = [45, 33, 45, 45, 45]\r\ntarget = 33\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these inputs, our first binary-search step would have the following indices:\r\n\r\n```\r\nleftIdx = 0 // 45\r\nmiddleIdx = 2 // 45\r\nrightIdx = 4 // 45\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would then compare the left 45 to the middle 45 and conclude that the left half of the array was sorted, since 45 <= 45.\r\n\r\nThis would be incorrect, since the left subarray [45, 33, 45] clearly isn't sorted.\r\n\r\nThis would lead our algorithm down the wrong path, and our function would end up returning -1, which would be incorrect.","basename":"shifted-binary-search"},"shortest-bridge":{"title":"Shortest Bridge","description":"Return the smallest number of 0's you must flip to connect the two islands.","tags":["graph","medium","bfs"],"link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-bridge/","images":[],"preview":"### Description\r\n\r\nYou are given an `n x n` binary matrix grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.\r\n\r\nAn island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1's not connected to any other 1's.

The issue with this approach is that there are 9^81 possible 9x9 Sudoku boards. This is an extremely large number, which makes it practically impossible to take this approach. How can you avoid generating every possible Sudoku board?\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> Keep in mind that a Sudoku board doesn't need to be entirely filled to figure out if it's invalid and won't lead to a solution. Try generating partially filled Sudoku boards until they become invalid, thereby abandoning solutions that will never lead to a properly solved board.\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> The method described in Hint #2 is more formally known as backtracking. This involves attempting to place digits into empty positions in the Sudoku board and checking at each insertion if that newly inserted digit makes the Sudoku board invalid. If it does, then you try to insert another digit until you find one that doesn't invalidate the board. If it doesn't invalidate the board, you temporarily place that digit and continue to try to solve the rest of the board. If you ever reach a position where there are no valid digits to be inserted (every digit placed in that position leads to an invalid board), that means that one of the previously inserted digits is incorrect. Thus, you must backtrack and change previously placed digits.

If multiple optimal assignments exist, any correct answer will be accepted.\r\n\r\nNote: you'll always be given at least one worker (i.e., k will always be greater than 0).\r\n\r\n## Sample Input\r\n\r\n```\r\nk = 3\r\ntasks = [1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 4]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sample Output\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  [0, 2], // tasks[0] = 1, tasks[2] = 5 | 1 + 5 = 6\r\n  [4, 5], // tasks[4] = 1, tasks[5] = 4 | 1 + 4 = 5\r\n  [1, 3], // tasks[1] = 3, tasks[3] = 3 | 3 + 3 = 6\r\n] // The fastest time to complete all tasks is 6.\r\n\r\n// Note: there are multiple correct answers for this sample input.\r\n// The following is an example of another correct answer:\r\n// [\r\n//   [2, 4],\r\n//   [0, 5],\r\n//   [1, 3]\r\n// [\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Hints\r\n\r\nHint 1\r\n> Start by considering which pairs of tasks will lead to the longest possible time to complete all tasks.\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> The amount of time it'll take to complete all tasks will be dictated by the pair of tasks that has the longest total duration. This means that you'll want to avoid pairing long tasks together.\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> Since the pair of tasks with the longest total duration is the time it takes for us to finish all tasks, we want to minimize this pair's duration. To do this, we can simply pair the shortest-duration task with the longest-duration task and repeat the process with all other tasks.\r\n\r\nHint 4\r\n> Start by sorting the tasks array in ascending order. Then, pair the shortest-duration task with the longest-duration task, and add that pair to some output array. Repeat this process until you've paired all tasks. This will lead to an optimal pairing, because your pair of tasks with the longest duration will have the shortest duration that it can possibly have.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptimal Space & Time Complexity\r\nO(nlog(n)) time | O(n) space - where n is the number of tasks\r\n```","basename":"task-assigment"},"task-scheduler":{"title":"Task Scheduler","description":"Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.","tags":["neetcode","medium","heap"],"link":"https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/","images":[],"preview":"### Description\r\n\r\nGiven a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task.

How can you traverse this graph to topologically sort the list of jobs?\r\n\r\nHint 2\r\n> One approach to solving this problem is to traverse the graph mentioned in Hint #1 using Depth-first Search. Starting at a random job, traverse its prerequisite jobs in Depth-first Search fashion until you reach a job with no prerequisites; such a job can safely be appended to the final order. Once you've traversed and added all prerequisites of a job to the final order, you can append the job in question to the order. This approach will have to track whether nodes have been traversed already, whether they're in the process of being traversed (which would indicate a cycle in the graph and therefore no valid topological order), or whether they're ready to be traversed.\r\n\r\nHint 3\r\n> Another approach to solving this problem is to traverse the graph mentioned in Hint #1 starting specifically with jobs that have no prerequisites. Keep track of all the jobs that have no prerequisites, traverse them one by one, and append them to the final order. For all of these jobs, remove their dependencies from the graph and update the number of prerequisites for each of these dependencies accordingly (these dependencies should now have one prerequisite less since one of their prerequisite job has just been added to the final order). As you update the number of prerequisites for these other jobs, keep track of the ones that no longer have prerequisites and that are ready to be traversed. You'll eventually go through all of the jobs if there are no cycles in the graph. If there is a cycle in the graph, there will still be jobs with prerequisites and you'll know that there is no valid topological order.

A node N is an ancestor of another node M if M is a descendant of N.\r\n\r\nIt isn't guaranteed that nodeOne or nodeThree will be ancestors or descendants of nodeTwo, but it is guaranteed that all three nodes will be unique and will never be None / null. In other words, you'll be given valid input nodes.\r\n\r\nEach BST node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null.\r\n\r\n## Sample Input\r\n\r\n``` \r\ntree =    5\r\n       /     \\\r\n      2       7\r\n    /   \\   /   \\\r\n   1     4 6     8\r\n  /     /\r\n 0     3  \r\n// This tree won't actually be passed as an input; it's here to help you visualize the problem.\r\nnodeOne = 5 // The actual node with value 5.\r\nnodeTwo = 2 // The actual node with value 2.\r\nnodeThree = 3 // The actual node with value 3.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Sample Output\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrue // nodeOne is an ancestor of nodeTwo, and nodeThree is a descendant of nodeTwo.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Hints\r\n\r\n```\r\nHint 1\r\nKeep in mind that the nodes passed to you are contained in a Binary Search Tree—not just a normal Binary Tree. How might this help you traverse the tree faster?\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nHint 2\r\nThere are multiple ways to solve this problem, but the simplest is to just check the possible relationships between the nodes. Since you're looking for a descendant and an ancestor, simply check if nodeOne is a descendant of nodeTwo, and if it is, then check if nodeThree is an ancestor of nodeTwo. If the previous checks come out negative, check if nodeThree is a descendant of nodeTwo, and if it is, then check if nodeOne is an ancestor of nodeTwo.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nHint 3\r\nAlthough the approach mentioned in Hint #2 is fairly efficient (it runs in O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree), there's a way to solve this problem faster. It involves realizing that, when searching for nodeTwo from either nodeOne or nodeThree, if you ever reach nodeThree from nodeOne or nodeOne from nodeThree before reaching nodeTwo, then you can immediately stop the algorithm, because nodeTwo cannot be between these nodes. See the Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation for a more in-depth explanation.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nOptimal Space & Time Complexity\r\nO(d) time | O(1) space - where d is the distance between nodeOne and nodeThree\r\n```","basename":"validate-three-nodes"},"walls-and-gates":{"title":"Walls and Gates","description":"Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate.

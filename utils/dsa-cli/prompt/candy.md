### Description

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

    Each child must have at least one candy.
    Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

```

### Example 2

```bash
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4

The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

-       1 <= n <= 2 * 104
-       0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

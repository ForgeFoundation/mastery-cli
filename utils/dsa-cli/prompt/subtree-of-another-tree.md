### Description

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return true if there is a subtree of root with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in tree and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

### Example 1

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/tree1.jpg)

```bash
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: true
```

### Example 2

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/tree2.jpg)

```bash
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the root tree is in the range [1, 2000]. 
- The number of nodes in the subRoot tree is in the range [1, 1000]. 
- -10^4 <= root.val <= 10^4 
- -10^4 <= subRoot.val <= 10^4

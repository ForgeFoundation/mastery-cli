### Description

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

    Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer target, return `true` if `target` is in `matrix` or `false` otherwise.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

### Example 1

![figure1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat.jpg)

```bash
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

### Example 2

![figure2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/05/mat2.jpg)

```bash
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 100
- -104 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 104

### Description

Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a **palindrome**. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

```

### Example 2

```bash
Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 16 
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

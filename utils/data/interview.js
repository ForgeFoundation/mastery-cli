Another way to weigh a plane is to use a hydraulic jack and a pressure gauge. We can lift the plane off the ground using the jack and measure the pressure exerted by the plane's weight on the jack using the pressure gauge. From there, we can calculate the weight of the plane based on the pressure reading."

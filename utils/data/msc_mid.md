### Prompt

• 700-1000 w

you will write a blog about two of the migrant communities we have  studied so far, using at least two of the articles we read in class to help you. You will narrate the
story of how these immigrants came to the United States, under what circumstances, and what brought them here. You will then talk about some of their most significant music, providing links to YouTube videos and explaining why the songs you picked are relevant to know. Finally, you will conclude your work by placing the music of these communities within the realm of World Music today.

 You should answer questions such as, is this music still recorded commercially? 

Has this music changed from traditional music-making to a more globalized one?

Do artists compromise their traditional way of making music to appeal to a global audience? 

Or, have these musics always been global in one way or another?

The assignment is a blog post and not an academic paper. Even though your tone should be for a general audience, remember to cite your sources. For this assignment, you are not allowed to use Wikipedia, as it is not a reliable source of information. Instead, use the library’s databases to complete your research. I will provide some useful links that can help you.

Frank Sinatra and Dominican Bachata represent two distinct musical genres and cultural backgrounds. Here is a comparison and contrast of these two musical styles:

Origin and background:
Frank Sinatra (1915-1998) was an American singer, actor, and producer. He is one of the most iconic figures in the history of American music, known for his unique voice and smooth, easy-listening style. Sinatra was primarily associated with traditional pop, swing, and jazz music.
Dominican Bachata is a genre of music that originated in the Dominican Republic in the early 1960s. It is a fusion of various musical influences, including African rhythms, Cuban bolero, and traditional Dominican folk music. Bachata is characterized by its romantic lyrics and the prominent use of the guitar.

Musical style and instrumentation:
Frank Sinatra's music was typically accompanied by a big band or orchestra, featuring instruments such as brass, woodwinds, and strings. His singing style was characterized by his smooth, rich tone and exceptional phrasing. He often sang about love, heartbreak, and the ups and downs of life, with a sense of vulnerability and emotion that resonated with listeners.
Dominican Bachata, on the other hand, is characterized by a distinct, syncopated rhythm played on the guitar. Other key instruments include the bongo, güira (a metal scraper), and bass guitar. Bachata is typically an upbeat, danceable genre, with a strong focus on romantic themes, often exploring the complexities of love and relationships.

Cultural significance:
Frank Sinatra's music was a reflection of the mid-20th century American culture and the evolving tastes of the time. He helped popularize swing and jazz music, and his career spanned multiple decades, leaving a lasting impact on American popular culture.
Dominican Bachata is an important part of the Dominican Republic's cultural heritage, showcasing the country's rich musical tradition. In recent years, it has gained international popularity, with artists like Romeo Santos, Prince Royce, and Aventura introducing the genre to a wider audience.

Dance styles:
While Frank Sinatra's music is often enjoyed for listening or slow dancing, it is not specifically associated with a particular dance style.
In contrast, Dominican Bachata is intrinsically linked to a specific dance style, also called bachata. The dance is characterized by close partner connection, sensual hip movements, and a basic four-step pattern that incorporates various turns and styling.

In summary, Frank Sinatra and Dominican Bachata are two distinct musical styles, with Sinatra representing American popular music and jazz, while Dominican Bachata reflects the rich cultural heritage of the Dominican Republic. Both have had significant impacts on their respective cultures and continue to influence music and dance worldwide.

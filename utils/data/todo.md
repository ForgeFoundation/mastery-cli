Why do u like programming?

Because I am dumb, when I compare myself to my peers, I don't have the reflexes, or math speed calculations that it takes, neither the memory or the strong sense of intuition, I see programming as a way I can enhance and breach that difference. As any technology is a tool, I hope I can use to enhance the human capabilities.

Therefore the projects I love to make are those who automate or fascilitate processes, specificaly I am interested when there is competition


### Projects

Here (4) large assistant wise projects that I am interested in making:

- Maid üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è (Fastapi + Node)
  - Trains you on the desktop
  - Better algorithms, better social, better knowledge and memory
  - Practice on the daily and be sharpened for your career.
  - Organize your priorities.



<!-- Strategy +  -->

- Priest üßë‚Äçüé§ (Asp.net + Flutter)
  - Finance management
  - Social Memory
  - Birthday Reminders
  - L Interests
  - Social Situation Practice.
  - Take notes on Gym workouts.
  - Journals.


<!-- I am considering using Rust to create a Debian tool + Java Backend. -->
- Valkyre üßë‚Äçüè´ (Whatever works for Ubuntu Servers + Python for data science)
  - Helps you improve researching the market situations, automatically crrwals the web for you.
    - Algorithms to understand downturns of economy
    - Gathers informations about real estate
    - Stocks, and other usual reports to help you make better decisions.


- Knight -> Help me compete in grinding and competition like games.
  - A collection of game assitants.
  - This could be a way to win games, and support friends to win games
  - [FPS Object recognition](https://github.com/petercunha/Pine/blob/master/demo/YOLO%20Research%20Paper.pdf)
- Buttler üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è
  - This would be an hologram based assistant that helps u manage family
  - For example it would contian the values your kids progresses academically 
  - And also be a support system to keep kids engaged.
  - Help you organize your own legacy.


### My Philosophy on CS

Because the mastery of CS is the mastery of all. Mastery of intelligence, math and strategy is the mastery of all. I love learning, I want to master all kinds of skills during my lifetime, however, unfortunaly I am aware of my limitations, and I know that I just dont have enough time to be a master of all. However with AI and CS, I can become a master of all. Master the world of abstract to master the world of in person.

Which means
- What I should focus on is on learning strategies, ai, getting deep into the abstract.
- Learning just the basics of one framework for each purpose is more than good enough.
- I still have 40+ years of career to be a master of this.
- From now on your approach into learning things are into how you could you build an AI/CS/Datastructure to master this skillset for me type of approach?
- Mastery of CS is the mastery of all, and I want to master all, therefore I want to master CS.
- Mastery of Physical Craftmanship  high plane.(Anything that can't be digitalized.)



1. Language Processing.
2. Image Processing.
3. Tree-Branch Search AI Strategies.
4. Data Science and Math.

### About Inheriting My Father's Business

Things that I believe I should focus on learning
- Social Skills
- Having a background of starting businesses from zero (Own app development)
- Ability to quickly prototype and test ideas with Software
- Massive distribution of marketinr and research. 


### How can I exponentially become better in CS/business?

- I can think that there are at least 40+ years to this career.
- How can I improve in such a stacky way so that I can have an exponential unfair advantage on my end?
- Is there a way I can create, or accumulate creations in such a way?
- A test environment where I am in continuous practice?
- I should be glad that at least with Maid, I can sustain my growth.(Continuous Practice.)
- How can I automate this process of study? Or how can I take ever so more into my learning process? Or at least how can I refine how to speedup my learning process?
- Is there a way to use AI to continually create trainning sets for myself?
- And focus my work into creating ai related programs, while I just learn how to build better ai?
- Is my job to build pipelines?


### Why this is a Break or Make Decade

- So, I was expecting I could take some time to improve myself, to isolate myself and become a master of Statistics and Algorithms.
- Playing the games and mastering games such as Factorio, Strategy Games, and other strategic games.
- Also build AI intelligence to support me in career and gaems (knight)

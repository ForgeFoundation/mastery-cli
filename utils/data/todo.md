Why do u like programming?

Because I am dumb, when I compare myself to my peers, I don't have the reflexes, or math speed calculations that it takes, neither the memory or the strong sense of intuition, I see programming as a way I can enhance and breach that difference. As any technology is a tool, I hope I can use to enhance the human capabilities.

Therefore the projects I love to make are those who automate or fascilitate processes, specificaly I am interested when there is competition

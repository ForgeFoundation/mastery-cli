Why do u like programming?

Because I am dumb, when I compare myself to my peers, I don't have the reflexes, or math speed calculations that it takes, neither the memory or the strong sense of intuition, I see programming as a way I can enhance and breach that difference. As any technology is a tool, I hope I can use to enhance the human capabilities.

Therefore the projects I love to make are those who automate or fascilitate processes, specificaly I am interested when there is competition


## Projects

Here (4) large assistant wise projects that I am interested in making:

- Maid üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è (Fastapi + Node)
  - Trains you on the desktop
  - Better algorithms, better social, better knowledge and memory
  - Practice on the daily and be sharpened for your career.
  - Organize your priorities.



<!-- Strategy +  -->

- Priest üßë‚Äçüé§ (Asp.net + Flutter)
  - Finance management
  - Social Memory
  - Birthday Reminders
  - L Interests
  - Social Situation Practice.
  - Take notes on Gym workouts.
  - Allow a pc combination, as the sdk should be accesed by both the flutter mobile app, as well as the terminal cli and also the Web app (If eventually one is developed)
  - Journals 
    - Registering one life Philosophy regarding a certain topic
  - Faith Journal and 
  - Building eventually a community of "Building your own faith group," where ideas are exchanged in respect to something else. Where they tell themselves how to design their life values, and we are there to assist them with tools and patterns.


<!-- I am considering using Rust to create a Debian tool + Java Backend. -->
- Valkyre üßë‚Äçüè´ (Whatever works for Ubuntu Servers + Python for data science)
  - Helps you improve researching the market situations, automatically crrwals the web for you.
    - Algorithms to understand downturns of economy
    - Gathers informations about real estate
    - Stocks, and other usual reports to help you make better decisions.

I wanted to originally build this on Rust, but my guess is that I could have some type of manager that interacts with Python Script (Individual around the place. You can think of it as the wings of the Valkyre.)


- Knight -> Help me compete in grinding and competition like games.
  - A collection of game assitants.
  - This could be a way to win games, and support friends to win games
  - [FPS Object recognition](https://github.com/petercunha/Pine/blob/master/demo/YOLO%20Research%20Paper.pdf)
- Buttler üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è
  - This would be an hologram based assistant that helps u manage family
  - For example it would contian the values your kids progresses academically 
  - And also be a support system to keep kids engaged.
  - Help you organize your own legacy.


## My Philosophy on CS

Because the mastery of CS is the mastery of all. Mastery of intelligence, math, neetcode and strategy is the mastery of all. I love learning, I want to master all kinds of skills during my lifetime, however, unfortunaly I am aware of my limitations, and I know that I just dont have enough time to be a master of all. However with AI and CS, I can become a master of all. Master the world of abstract to master the world of in person.

Which means
- What I should focus on is on learning strategies, ai, getting deep into the abstract.
- Learning just the basics of one framework for each purpose is more than good enough.
- I still have 40+ years of career to be a master of this.
- From now on your approach into learning things are into how you could you build an AI/CS/Datastructure to master this skillset for me type of approach?
- Mastery of CS is the mastery of all, and I want to master all, therefore I want to master CS.
- Mastery of Physical Craftmanship  high plane.(Anything that can't be digitalized.)
- To add into the 
- Watching video lectures, are still useful and adding general knowledge to automatic learning is still useful as they help digesting the contents.



1. Language Processing.
2. Image Processing.
3. Tree-Branch Search AI Strategies.
4. Data Science and Math.


### Classes

- Accept that taking a exam, you might have dumb ass mistakes like just recently April 18-2023 I confused DFS with BFS for some shit reason so I got -10, when I could have 84 for the exam like fkkk.
- How do I avoid this kind of mistakes?
  - I was already making the DFS and BFS mistake already at the practices, why was that happening?
  - Lack of Sleep?
  - They were easy problems so I must have lowered my guard.
  - Next time I should double check specially dumb mistakes.
  - At least I learnt that some things do belong to Anki, (Exact midterms slides) and others do belong to long term maid sets (Basic understanding so far.)
- I should accept that what is important is the test sets that I create for me to improve on the long run: Understanding of AI, and better study skills (Flashing cards and so forth)

## About Inheriting My Father's Business

Things that I believe I should focus on learning
- Social Skills
- Having a background of starting businesses from zero (Own app development)
- Ability to quickly prototype and test ideas with Software
- Massive distribution of marketinr and research. 


## How can I exponentially become better in CS/business?

- I can think that there are at least 40+ years to this career.
- How can I improve in such a stacky way so that I can have an exponential unfair advantage on my end?
- Is there a way I can create, or accumulate creations in such a way?
- A test environment where I am in continuous practice?
- I should be glad that at least with Maid, I can sustain my growth.(Continuous Practice.)
- How can I automate this process of study? Or how can I take ever so more into my learning process? Or at least how can I refine how to speedup my learning process?
- Is there a way to use AI to continually create trainning sets for myself?
- And focus my work into creating ai related programs, while I just learn how to build better ai?
- Is my job to build pipelines?


## Why this is a Break or Make Decade

- So, I was expecting I could take some time to improve myself, to isolate myself and become a master of Statistics and Algorithms.
- Playing the games and mastering games such as Factorio, Strategy Games, and other strategic games.
- Also build AI intelligence to support me in career and gaems (knight)


### The theory of Problem Solving.

- I think problem solving at least with the ideas of cues is the generation of patterns.
- Sequences can be time, space, or any measurable count.
- Patterns is the prediction of an output over a sequence.
- Visualization of algorithms does, is great for understanding the concepts => You should try to visualize them all.
  - And then run in your head how it would work. => Your algorithmic hints could be your pictures. But is there a quick way to add that?
- For this to work my biggest iddle is in the inbetween recollection of things. 
- Sometimes the problem is looking at "What is inside, or what's in the world that relates to this symbol?"
  - Is about finding cues about where to research and quickly spin up the world to figure out the answers for where to focus the research.
- In conclusion you could say that problem solving is obsessing over a problems details and matching the pattern to the external world.


From Escape the Room to Business and life. These are the steps in Escape Room



- 1. Map and Document the clues as well as to build connections between them. 
  - 1.1. Search, and collect information scattered around by moving things.
  - 1.2 Understanding mechanisms by interacting with them.
  - 1.3 Figuring out the accepted inputs on the prompt.
- 2. Solving it.
  - 2.1 Communicate with the other players to build a shared understanding of the clues while attempting to solve them. (Especially if is a real-time notation of things)


How can this be generalized to the world of business problem solving:

- 1. Find the clues
  - 1.1 Grab the problem, break it down into which pieces can be opened for research. 
  - 1.2 Map your suspisions into how do these compoenents affect the problem.
- 2. Research
  - Research about similar problems and knowledge domains that the component touches. 
  - Research about the behavior of the component on different context/inputs/external actions.


**How can this strategy be utilized on the ddapp?**
- Perphaps I should learn to break down the ddapp into components. As a software engineering my resolution is to break it down into the right answers not as what I believe would be the best tecnical solution but to hwo am I expected as an employee.


Perphaps should I keep track all my painpoints, and start writing the inputs or factors that affect the problem output in the engine (simptoms => from which system (closest relationship) => how to solve the problem)

**Why I haven't been using this doctrine on my life?**
- Lack of true ambition.
- Lack of faith that anything is possible with pure discipline.

I think therefore that the problem is that I lack of ambition and faith. These two factors, how can I modify them?


**How can I naturally use this doctrine in my life?**
- Is this the doctrine u want to achieve?


How to specify this into the world of the software engineer:

Therefore a method to improve in this area is:



**Recovering not faith, but the drive to go all in again.**

- Is not blind faith in hardwork, but the drive to work with all your portential and trully believe in that itself.
- Similar to how valhalla is there for those vikings that fight to their deaths, is not that they don't know that they will die, but is that they are in full belief that if they die fighting, that is honor. Because thats the beauty they bring to life to the afterlife.
- Similarly I should understand that there is one life
- And what we do with our piece on finite life is what is there to be representing us in the eternal. Our life is a craft that we are building, and whenever death comes. One should be happy to live a life fullfilled.


Proposition 1.1: The world is a game, and the game is to be the best version of yourself.
- Or a short reminder everytime u open ur phone, or a reminder everytime u open ur computer.
- Prompt the user to journal his relation to this faith on the daily. And prompt how close to the faith fundamentaal truth is. Or if it derives from something else.
- Research how religions keep people faithful with a religion? How can I use this to keep myself faithful to this doctrine?
- It would be nice if I could find some days to just research and research about different philosophies and see what works, or what questions do they attempt to answer, as well as to see how this can help you make you believe in the doctrine with more reason.
- So on the daily as a prompt I can remark things other religions think about certain topic, and how your faith responds to that fundamental question. 
- Perphaps this can be computed using the research of how sudoku's work. by writting down what paths can't be taken and thus deduce the answer.



###  Gaming and the world of business (Strategy)

I think gaems shoudl also  be added to the list of things to learn. As I develop strategies and pipelines to become better in games, I can also get that influence to learn how to run things on the real world. Similar, anything that is an exercise, be it a homework or a game, can be used to train your mind to be better at solving problems.

- The important area of the games and so forth is to be able to pull them out of their envirment and to be generalized, and to accept that trainning could be done.

- Is important not to become obsessed to the game to the point that you can't see the bigger picture. 
  

- 5D Chess
- Something that I started with was immediatelly watching videos
- Soemthing that helped was also doing the game with a partner
- Also playing the introduction puzzles really helped on the game (PLaying the game => puzzles -> game ai again)
- Reading the manual and accepting not understanding is also part of the game
- Documentation of the puzzles was also important As well as a mental practice to make sure that the idea is on your head..
- Also the development of heuristics to understand cues as to when to use each piece through practice and trial
- As well as looking how other people did things.


For example this pipeline generalized for math can be seen as:

- Raw attempt to solve the problem (keep it short)
- Go to class (Watch the tutorial and read over the theorics, it is okay to proceed withouth fully understanding)
- Run the exercises
- Document the exercises
- Study the exercises and reread the documentation
- Implmenet them in the game (or in the real world)

My guess is that is the obsession the with excercises that get you a better approach


How could you generalize this learning process?

What improvements on these process can be done?

- Having the quick access to the practice enviornment is important 
- Storign this imformation as digital notes is important as it is easier to document and analize.
- 


### What to do on my 6 month mental-break?

Should I focus on career over passion projects? What is the advantage of each?

- I study algorithms => Create graphs and charts. => Probably need to repurchase Algoexperts or at least record the hard problems.
- I study and improve at math => Calculus, Data Science Math, Strong Understanding of Statistics, Number Theory
- Get lean, get big, Learn how to massage, morning routine and strong diet.
- Passion Project? => Get strong at Flutter - Take advantage of MacOS
  - Book Project: Flutter
  - Any project that her brother/syster might want me to do and stuff.
- 


Low Priorty:
- Perphaps practice more car driving with mom's car? Low



## Negotiating

Steven, I enjoy working here and I am willing to work for less and more hours. This summer I want to get married to my highschool sweatheart, she is living to Argentina so I will have to move to the country. I know that I dont have the vacation dates to make the papers, is it okay if I request the chance on working remotely for what I am estimating is 3 to 6 months? The time difference is of two, and since I wouldnt be travelling, I am happy to start working 2-3 hours more 1 hour earlier and finish working 2 hours later to match Danny's time. I will also be super communicative, and being reporting to Danny everyday to keep things on their momentum and going. Also as for pay I am also willing to take a lower pay if that helps.


- Because I require to make the papers, and this is more like an moral sense, she is going to give me her all, the least I can do is stay with her until the papers are done right?

- You dont need to tell me the answer right away, I can come back later for the request.

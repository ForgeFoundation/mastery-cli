Why do u like programming?

Because I am dumb, when I compare myself to my peers, I don't have the reflexes, or math speed calculations that it takes, neither the memory or the strong sense of intuition, I see programming as a way I can enhance and breach that difference. As any technology is a tool, I hope I can use to enhance the human capabilities.

Therefore the projects I love to make are those who automate or fascilitate processes, specificaly I am interested when there is competition

### My Philosophy on CS

Because the mastery of CS is the mastery of all. Mastery of intelligence, math and strategy is the mastery of all. I love learning, I want to master all kinds of skills during my lifetime, however, unfortunaly I am aware of my limitations, and I know that I just dont have enough time to be a master of all. However with AI and CS, I can become a master of all. Master the world of abstract to master the world of in person.

Which means
- What I should focus on is on learning strategies, ai, getting deep into the abstract.
- Learning just the basics of one framework for each purpose is more than good enough.
- I still have 40+ years of career to be a master of this.
- From now on your approach into learning things are into how you could you build an AI/CS/Datastructure to master this skillset for me type of approach?
- Mastery of CS is the mastery of all, and I want to master all, therefore I want to master CS.
- Mastery of Physical Craftmanship  high plane.(Anything that can't be digitalized.)

        description: "Heaps are a specialized tree-based data structure that are used for various purposes such as priority queues, sorting, graph algorithms, and memory management. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using heaps:\
        \n\
        Advantages:\
        Fast Insertion and Extraction: Heaps have a fast time complexity for insertion and extraction operations, making them suitable for use in situations where elements are frequently added or removed.\
        Efficient Priority Queue: Heaps can be used to implement priority queues, which are used in many algorithms to efficiently extract the element with the highest or lowest priority.\
        Sorting: Heapsort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n log n) which is efficient for sorting large datasets.\
        Memory Management: Heaps are used in memory management to allocate memory dynamically to a program at runtime.\Disadvantages:\
        \n\
        Slow Random Access: Heaps are not well suited for random access, as the time complexity for searching for a specific element is O(n)\
        Not Cache-Friendly: Heaps are not cache-friendly, as the elements are not stored contiguously in memory, which can lead to cache misses and slow down the performance of the application.\
        Complexity: Heaps can be complex to implement, especially when compared to simpler data structures such as arrays or linked lists.\
        In summary, heaps have advantages such as fast insertion and extraction, efficient priority queue, sorting, and memory management. However, they also have some disadvantages such as slow random access, not being cache-friendly and complexity to implement. It's worth noting that using Heaps is not always the best option, it depends on the problem and the use case, for instance, if you require random access or cache-friendliness, then you might want to consider other data structures like balanced trees."

        Continuous integration puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch.\n\n\
        What you need (cost) - Your team will need to write automated tests for each new feature, improvement or bug fix. You need a continuous integration server that can monitor the main repository and run the tests automatically for every new commits pushed. Developers need to merge their changes as often as possible, at least once a day.\n\n\
        What you gain: Less bugs get shipped to production as regressions are captured early by the automated tests. Building the release is easy as all integration issues have been solved early. Less context switching as developers are alerted as soon as they break the build and can work on fixing it before they move to another task. Testing costs are reduced drastically – your CI server can run hundreds of tests in the matter of seconds.

Your team will most likely need to embrace feature flags so that incomplete features do not affect customers in production. What you gain: The complexity of deploying software has been taken away.

        example: "application-visible sharding policy using relational databases… \n\
         Advantages:      If your shard key is well-chosen, and the machinery for getting apps to connect to the right shard instance for a given piece of data is well-done, you can scale your world basically infinitely. If you are going to have a multi-petabyte relational db world, you have to shard.     Sharding also allows your individual instances to not be overly huge, reducing performance and general instance management issues.     Lots of shards mitigate problems that affect individual instances. With one huge DB, an outage takes the whole site down. With 100 shards, a single-instance outage affects only 1% of your dataworld. \n\n\
         Disadvantages:      Shards can be complicated to get right, particularly if your shard key isn’t obvious.     You occasionally have to worry about splitting shards, or very occasionally about merging shards. This can be quite complicated.     Applications need to be aware of the details of database organization, at least at some level.     Joins across shards are not easily doable. If you need to do cross-shard joining, you probably need a data warehouse or some type of alternate reporting dataworld. Wherever possible, you should restrict “galactic” reporting to joins that can be done within shards and “merged” by applications above the db, or by sending the bits of data (audit tables, etc) to the reporting world and running reports ther"

        description: "Long polling is different from traditional polling as the server does not have to respond immediately; it accepts the request and lets the client know once the data is ready. This way, the client does not have to keep requesting new data and gets an empty response if no update is available.",
        example: "Long polling advantages      Long polling is implemented on the back of XMLHttpRequest, which is near-universally supported by devices so there’s usually little need to support further fallback layers.     In cases where exceptions must be handled though, or where a server can be queried for new data but does not support long polling (let alone other more modern technology standards), basic polling can sometimes still be of limited use, and can be implemented using XMLHttpRequest, or via JSONP through simple HTML script tags.\n\
        \nLong polling disadvantages      Long polling is more resource intensive on the server than a WebSocket connection.     Long polling can come with a latency overhead because it requires several hops between servers and devices. Gateways often have different ideas of how long a typical connection is allowed to stay open, so sometimes close while processing is still underway.     Reliable message ordering can be an issue with long polling because it is possible for multiple HTTP requests from the same client to be in flight simultaneously. For example, if a client has two browser tabs open consuming the same server resource, and the client-side application is persisting data to a local store such as localStorage or IndexedDb, there is no in-built guarantee that duplicate data won’t be written more than once.     Depending on the server implementation, confirmation of message receipt by one client instance may also cause another client instance to never receive an expected message at all, as the server could mistakenly believe that the client has already received the data it is expecting."

        (1) The Creator abstract class, which defines a factory method that returns an object of the Product type.\n \
        \n \
        (2) The ConcreteCreator subclasses, which implement the factory method and return an instance of a ConcreteProduct.\n \
        \n \
        (3) The Product interface, which defines the type of objects that the factory method creates.\n \
        \n \
        The advantage of using the Factory Method pattern is that it allows you to encapsulate the process of creating objects and make it more flexible. Because the client code only interacts with the Creator class through the factory method, it can be changed to create a different type of object without affecting the client code. This can be useful in cases where the type of object to be created is not known until runtime, or where the client code should not be tightly coupled to the classes that are responsible for creating the objects. It also allows to provide a single point of control over the creation process and can add additional functionality such as caching, logging, etc. In summary, the Factory Method pattern is a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created, providing a way to centralize and encapsulate the creation process, making it more flexible and maintainable."

        term: "Adapters", description: "The Adapter design pattern is used to convert the interface of one class into another interface that the client expects. Here are some advantages and disadvantages of using adapters:\n \
        Advantages:\n \
        Improved compatibility: Adapters allow existing classes to work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.\n \
        Increased reusability: Adapters can make it easier to reuse existing code by converting it to a form that is more appropriate for the current application.\n \
        Increased flexibility: Adapters can make it easier to change the interface of a class without modifying the class itself.\n \
        Loose coupling: Adapters allow the client and adaptee classes to be loosely coupled, so that changes to one class will not affect the other.\n \
        Disadvantages:\n \
        Increased complexity: Adapters can make the code more complex, especially in large codebases or when multiple adapters are used.\n \
        Reduced performance: Adapters can add an additional layer of indirection, which can slow down the performance of the application.\n \
        Harder to debug: Adapters can make it harder to debug the application, especially if the adaptee class is not well-documented or is hard to understand.\n \
        Limited functionality: Adapters can only convert the interface of a class, they cannot add new functionality to it."

        term: "The Bridge", description: "The Bridge design pattern is a structural pattern that is used to separate an abstraction from its implementation. It allows the two to evolve independently and provides a way to change the implementation of an abstraction without affecting its clients.\n \
        Advantages:\n \
        Decoupling: The Bridge pattern decouples the abstraction from the implementation, which makes it easier to change the implementation without affecting the clients.\n \
        Increased flexibility: The Bridge pattern allows for the implementation of an abstraction to be changed at runtime, making the code more flexible.\n \
        Improved maintainability: The Bridge pattern improves the maintainability of the code by allowing the abstraction and the implementation to evolve independently.\n \
        Reducing complexity: The Bridge pattern can be useful in situations where you want to avoid a combinatorial explosion of subclasses.\n \
        Disadvantages:\n \
        Increased complexity: The Bridge pattern can make the code more complex, especially in large codebases or when multiple bridges are used.\n \
        Reduced performance: The Bridge pattern can add an additional layer of indirection, which can slow down the performance of the application.\n \
        Limited functionality: The Bridge pattern can only separate the interface and implementation, it cannot add new functionality to it.\n \
        Harder to debug: The Bridge pattern can make it harder to debug the application, especially if the implementation class is not well-documented or is hard to understand.",
        prompt: "", example: "the Bridge design pattern is like having a remote control for your TV. The remote control is the abstraction, and the TV is the implementation. The remote control lets you change the channel, turn the volume up and down, and do other things, but it doesn't actually do anything on its own. It just sends signals to the TV, which is the part that actually changes the channel and adjusts the volume.\n \
        \n \
        The remote control and the TV can change independently of each other. For example, you can change the batteries in the remote control without affecting the TV. You can also buy a new TV that has different features, but you can still use your old remote control to control it. This is similar to how the Bridge pattern allows the abstraction and the implementation to evolve independently.\n \
        \n \
        So, the Bridge pattern is a way of connecting two things so they can work together, while still being able to change them independently. It makes the code more flexible and maintainable, but it can also make it more complex."

        term: "Composite Design Pattern", description: "The Composite design pattern is a way to structure a program so that it can have objects that are made up of other objects. Imagine that you have a school project where you have to build a tree out of different materials like paper, cardboard, and glue. The tree is made up of branches and leaves, and each branch is made up of smaller branches and leaves.\
        It allows you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects in the same way, making it easier to work with complex structures.\
        It promotes the Single Responsibility Principle by allowing each class to only handle its own specific part of the structure.\
        It promotes code reusability, as the same classes can be used to create different structures.\
        \
    Disadvantages of using the Composite design pattern include:\
        It can make code more complex and harder to understand, especially if there are many levels of nesting in the structure.\
        It can make it harder to debug the code, because it can be difficult to trace through the structure to find the source of an error.\

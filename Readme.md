## Features

### Study

- [ ] Ability To Generate Cloze (derivants of the concepts models)
- [ ] Ability to Generate a terms through an collection of XLSX (Derivant of Concept Models)
- [ ] Ability to Have a Cloze generator
- [ ] Ability to create a grouper (inserts tags such as category or type to the collection of jsons it represents)
- [ ] A Skill tree type strucutre which is useful for prioritizing and creating dependency for deck of cards and for books as well in general
  - [ ] The deck of cards would inherit from an Class type
  - [ ] I am thinking about a composite structure, where those who are not in the tree take random priority, and those who have more dependencies goes first
  - [ ] Implement the system so that the cards with gigher priority are selected first, or the tree sees the agroupations and checks if everything (pre cached) caclculates which deck to select.
  - [ ] This would actually be a smart way to make faster queries once I have way too many knowledge objects.
- [ ] Ability to Sync (At least one way up (and have subscribers to the decks)) 
- [ ] Ability to create

Your assistant to improve as a programmer. Flashcards, DSA Practice, Statistics, and habit hooks. For example, everytime you commit code, you could have a random flashcard being prompted (or even a random DSA problem suggestion to be completed!). Designed to work offline, but when connected to the internet assists you to collect your progress and sync it with your other devices. 

Other main features include:
- Helping you keep track on your personal goal projects e.g. Doing some commit in a project on a daily basi
- More than 150 programming problems (with tests that work offline)

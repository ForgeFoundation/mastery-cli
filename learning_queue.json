It's used to simplify the task of configuring devices on a network, as the DHCP server manages the assignment of IP addresses, rather than requiring manual configuration of each device.\n        When a device, such as a computer, connects to a network, it sends a broadcast request for an IP address. The DHCP server, which is usually built into a router, receives the request and assigns the device an available IP address from a pool of addresses. The DHCP server also assigns the device other information, such as the subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses. This process is called leasing an IP address and the lease has a limited time, after which the device will request a new lease.\n        DHCP makes it easy to add or remove devices from a network, as the DHCP server automatically assigns new addresses as needed and frees up addresses when devices are disconnected. This makes it an important component of most networks, especially in home or small office environments.","references":"","attachment":"","category":"network","prompt":"When do you encounter DHCP working?","priority":5,"slug":"dhcp","formula_name":"dhcp","attachment_is_url":false},"9":{"term":"Clonning vs Automation","example":"In general, automation is a better option for large organizations that need to perform installations on a large scale, while cloning is a good choice for small organizations or individual users who want a simple and fast installation process.","description":"Advantages of Automation:\n 1. Flexibility: Automation allows you to perform installations in a flexible manner, making it easier to adapt to changes in the environment. For example, you can add or remove components of your installation process as needed, which can save time and effort.\n2. Repeatability: Automation can ensure that installations are performed consistently and reliably, even across multiple systems. This reduces the risk of errors or inconsistencies in the installation process.\n3. Scalability: Automation can be used to automate installations across large numbers of systems, which makes it an attractive option for large organizations or data centers.\n Disadvantages of Automation:\n 1. Complexity: Automation can be complex to set up, particularly for inexperienced users.\n2. Maintenance: Automated installation processes need to be maintained, and updates need to be made as the environment changes.\n Advantages of Cloning:\n 1. Simplicity: Cloning is a simple process that can be performed quickly and easily, making it an attractive option for smaller organizations or individual users.\n2. Speed: Cloning can be faster than other installation methods, as the entire operating system and all installed software is copied to the target system.\n Disadvantages of Cloning:\n 1. Inflexibility: Cloning does not offer the same level of flexibility as automation, as changes made to the original system will be reflected in all cloned systems.\n2. Compatibility: Cloning may not always be compatible with different systems, and compatibility issues can arise if hardware components are not identical between systems.","references":"","attachment":"","category":"network","prompt":"In what situations would you clone vs automate an installation?","priority":5,"slug":"clonning-vs-automation","formula_name":"clonning-vs-automation","attachment_is_url":false},"10":{"term":"Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)","example":"","description":"Network booting is generally applied in a diskless environment using routers and centrally managed computers, also known as thin clients. \n        Centralized computing environments provide reduced maintenance costs, enhanced security and enhanced control over the system's workstations. \n        PXE code is generally delivered with computer machines on a ROM chip or a boot disk to enable remote boot and configuration.
